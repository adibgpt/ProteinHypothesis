Specifically, SHANK3 silencing led to a significant increase in Rap1 levels in the plasma membrane fraction and promoted talin recruitment to β1 integrin. SHANK1 silencing also increased talin recruitment to newly forming membrane protrusions. These changes in integrin activity led to increased cell migration velocity and a converse decrease in directionality of migration in both HEK293 and MDA MB 231 cells. Moreover, ASD-linked SHANK3 mutants are functionally deficient in binding to active Ras family members Rap1 and R Ras and in mediating integrin inhibition, suggesting that these mutations may contribute to the development of ASD by disrupting the regulation of integrin activity."

What is the function of the lac operon in E. coli?,synthesizes amino acids,regulates the transcription of genes involved in histidine biosynthesis,produces enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism,regulates the transcription of genes involved in lactose metabolism,,,option 4,"The lac operon is a genetic regulatory system found in E. coli that controls the transcription of genes involved in lactose metabolism. It is composed of three structural genes (lacZ, lacY, and lacA) that code for enzymes necessary for lactose digestion, as well as a regulatory gene (lacI) that codes for a repressor protein. When lactose is not present in the environment, the repressor protein binds to the operator region of the operon, preventing transcription of the structural genes.
