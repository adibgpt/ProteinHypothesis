        "response": "The provided data is not in CSV format; it's a series of key-value pairs where 'name' represents a composite identifier composed of an ID, a PDB code and a UniProt accession number, and 'sequence' represents an amino acid sequence.\n\nRow 1: The entry with name '>8021391|2DJA_A|Q9UJV3' contains the amino acid sequence 'VEPVPDTHLRGITCLDHENEKVNMYCVSDDQLICALCKLVGRHRDHQVASLNDRFEKLKQTLEMNLTNLVK'.  This suggests a protein sequence associated with ID 8021391, PDB code 2DJA, and UniProt accession Q9UJV3.  The sequence's length and composition might indicate a specific protein family or function.\n\nRow 2: The entry with name '>8002440|1IGN_A|P11938' has the amino acid sequence 'KRKFSADEDYTLAIAVKKQFYRDLFQIDPDTGRSLITDEDTPTAIARRNMTMDPNHVPGSEPNFAAYRTQSRRGPIAREFFKHFAEEHAAHTENAWRDRFRKFLLAYGIDDYISYYEAEKAQNREPEPMKNLTNRPKRPGVPTPGNYNS'. This longer sequence, associated with ID 8002440, PDB code 1IGN, and UniProt accession P11938, likely represents a larger protein with potentially diverse functional domains.\n\nRow 3: The entry with name '>8021188|1NRI_A|P44862' shows the sequence 'LSTLITEQRNPNSVDIDRQSTLEIVRLMNEEDKLVPLAIESCLPQISLAVEQIVQAFQQGGRLIYIGAGTSGRLGVLDASECPPTFGVSTEMVKGIIAGGECAIRHPVEGAEDNTKAVLNDLQSIHFSKNDVLVGIAASGRTPYVIAGLQYAKSLGALTISIASNPKSEMAEIADIAIETIVGPEILTGSSRLKSGTAQKMVLNMLTTASMILLGKCYENLMVDVQASNEKLKARAVRIVMQATDCNK'.  This protein, linked to ID 8021188, PDB code 1NRI, and UniProt accession P44862, possesses a very long sequence indicating a complex structure and potentially multiple functions.\n\nRow 4: The entry with name '>8090665|6MVF_A|D4K3H3' has the amino acid sequence 'PMVHIAGRRHAQRAGETTEVKVYSNQDTVTLYCNGKEVGTQTAHRVFKFDVALDEGFNVLMAVADTVKDSITLEKVE'.  This shorter sequence, for ID 8090665, PDB code 6MVF, and UniProt accession D4K3H3, suggests a smaller protein with a potentially more limited role.\n\nRow 5:  The entry with name '>8022417|2NN6_G|Q9NQT5' contains the sequence 'ARAARTVLGQVVLPGEELLLPEQEDAEGPGGAVERPLSLNARACSRVRVVCGPGLRRCGDRLLVTKCGRLRHKEPGSGSGGGVYWVDSQQK'.  This sequence, associated with ID 8022417, PDB code 2NN6, and UniProt accession Q9NQT5, displays a moderate length and  its amino acid composition might suggest a particular structural or functional motif.\n"
