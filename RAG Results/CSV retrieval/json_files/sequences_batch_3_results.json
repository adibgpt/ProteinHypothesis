This row represents a protein sequence from a sperm whale, identified by its UniProt ID,  belonging to the validation set of the dataset.\n\n**Row 2 (name: 103l):** Entry 103l has chain A, genes E, is from *Enterobacteria Phage T4*, has the sequence MNIFEMLRIDEGLRLKIYKDTEGYYTIGIGHLLTKSPSLNSLDAAKSELDKAIGRNTNGVITKDEAEKLFNQDVDAAVRGILRNAKLKPVYDSLDAVRRAALINMVFQMGETGVAGFTNSLRMLQQKRWDEAAVNLAKSRWYNQTPNRAKRVITTFRTGTWDAYKNL, is part of the validation set (train_part: val), and has UniProt ID P00720.  This row details a protein sequence from bacteriophage T4, also in the validation set and annotated with a UniProt ID.\n\n**Row 3 (name: 103d):** Entry 103d has chain B, no listed genes or organism, the sequence GTGGAATGGAAC, is part of the training set (train_part: train), and has no UniProt ID. This row represents a protein sequence fragment from an unknown organism belonging to the training set, lacking further annotation.\n\n**Row 4 (name: 104d - first instance):** Entry 104d has chain B, no listed genes or organism, the sequence CGCGTATACGCG, is part of the training set (train_part: train), and has no UniProt ID. This row, similar to the previous one, shows a short protein sequence fragment from an unknown source in the training set, lacking further information.\n\n**Row 5 (name: 104d - second instance):** Entry 104d has chain A, no listed genes or organism, the sequence CGCGTATACGCG, is part of the training set (train_part: train), and has no UniProt ID.  This is the same sequence as the previous 104d entry, but with a different chain designation (A instead of B), suggesting a potential error or duplication in the data.\n"
