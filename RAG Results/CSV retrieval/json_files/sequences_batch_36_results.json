This row represents an incomplete data entry from the training set, lacking crucial biological context.\n\n**Row 2:** The entry named '149l', with chain 'A', gene 'E', and organism 'Enterobacteria Phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4)', possesses the long sequence 'MNLFEMLRIDEGLRLKIYKDTEGYYTIGIGHLLTKSPSLNAAKSELDKAIGRNCNGVITKDEAEKLFNQDVDAAVRGILRNAKLKPVYDSLDAVRRCALINMVFQMGETGVAGFTNSLRMLQQKRWDEAAVNLAKSRWYNQTPNRAKRVITTFRTGTWDAYKNL', belongs to the validation set ('val_part'), and has UniProt ID P00720. This entry provides complete information for a protein sequence from bacteriophage T4, identified by its UniProt ID, and is designated for validation purposes.\n\n**Row 3:** The entry '149d', with chain 'A',  lacks gene and organism information, features the sequence 'CCTATTC', is part of the training set ('train_part'), and has no UniProt ID. Similar to the first entry, this row is an incomplete entry from the training set, missing crucial biological annotation.\n\n**Row 4:** The entry '148l', with chain 'S', gene 'E', and organism 'Enterobacteria Phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4)', has the short sequence 'AEKA', is part of the test set ('test_part'), and has UniProt ID P00720. This entry, also from bacteriophage T4,  is a short sequence included in the test set and shares the UniProt ID with row 2, suggesting potential relationship between the sequences.\n"
