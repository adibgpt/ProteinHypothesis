This row represents a sequence fragment from an unknown organism with no further protein identification.\n\n**Row 2:** The entry named \"115l\" features chain \"A\", gene \"E\", belongs to *Enterobacteria Phage T4* (Bacteriophage T4), possesses a long sequence \"MNIFEMLRIDEGLRLKIYKDTEGYYTIGIGHLLTKSPSLNAAKVELDKAIGRNTNGVITKDEAEKLFNQDVDAAVRGILRNAKLKPVYDSLDAVRRAALINMVFQMGETGVAGFTNSLRMLQQKRWDEAAVNLAKSRWYNQTPNRAKRVITTFRTGTWDAYKNL\", is part of the training set, and has a UniProt ID \"P00720\". This row describes a protein sequence from a bacteriophage, specifically gene E, with known UniProt annotation.\n\n**Row 3:** The entry \"115d\" has chain \"A\", unspecified genes and organism, a short sequence \"GGUAUACC\", is part of the training set, and lacks a UniProt ID. This represents a short sequence fragment of unknown origin and function.\n\n**Row 4:** The entry \"115d\" (duplicate name) has chain \"B\", unspecified genes and organism, a short sequence \"GGUAUACC\" (identical to the previous entry), is part of the training set, and lacks a UniProt ID. This is a duplicate entry with identical features to the previous row, suggesting a potential data entry error or a representation of a duplicated sequence within a protein structure.\n\n**Row 5:** The entry \"114l\" has chain \"A\", gene \"E\", belongs to *Enterobacteria Phage T4* (Bacteriophage T4), possesses a long sequence \"MNIFEMLRIDEGLRLKIYKDTEGYYTIGIGHLLTKSPSLNAAKTELDKAIGRNTNGVITKDEAEKLFNQDVDAAVRGILRNAKLKPVYDSLDAVRRAALINMVFQMGETGVAGFTNSLRMLQQKRWDEAAVNLAKSRWYNQTPNRAKRVITTFRTGTWDAYKNL\" (identical to row 2), is part of the training set, and has a UniProt ID \"P00720\".  This row is a duplicate of row 2, indicating potential redundancy in the dataset.\n"
