This suggests incomplete data for this entry, lacking crucial biological information.\n\n**Row 2:** The entry named '155c' is chain 'A', has gene 'cycA', is from *Paracoccus Denitrificans*, possesses a long sequence 'XNEGDAAKGEKEFNKCKACHMIQAPDGTDIKGGKTGPNLYGVVGRKIASEEGFKYGEGILEVAEKNPDLTWTEANLIEYVTDPKPLVKKMTDDKGAKTKMTFKMGKNQADVVAFLAQDDPDAXXXXXXXXXXXXX', is part of the test data ('test_part'), and has UniProt ID P00096.  This row represents a protein sequence from a known organism, designated for testing, and linked to a known protein in a database.\n\n**Row 3:** The entry '154l' is chain 'A', has unspecified genes, is from *Anser anser* (Western Greylag Goose), has a long sequence 'RTDCYGNVNRIDTTGASCKTAKPEGLSYCGVSASKKIAERDLQAMDRYKTIIKKVGEKLCVEPAVIAGIISRESHAGKVLKNGWGDRGNGFGLMQVDKRSHKPQGTWNGEVHITQGTTILINFIKTIQKKFPSWTKDQQLKGGISAYNAGAGNVRSYARMDIGTTHDDYANDVVARAQYYKQHGY', is part of the training data ('train_part'), and has UniProt ID P00718.
