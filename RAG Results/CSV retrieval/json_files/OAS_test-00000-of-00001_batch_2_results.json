        "response": "The provided data is not in CSV format; it's a list of key-value pairs where the key is a name (apparently an ID) and the value is a sequence string, often split by a pipe symbol \"|\".  Therefore, a detailed description as requested for a CSV file cannot be generated.  I can, however, describe each entry individually:\n\n\n**Entry 1:**  The entry with name `>28af11ff-50a2-4e94-b1ec-07abd3f8d341|_B` contains a sequence string `EIVMTQSPATLSVSPGERATLSCRASQSVSSNLAWYQQKPGQAPRLLIYGASTRATGIPARFSGSGSGTEFTVTISSLQSEDFAVYYCQQYNNWPSFGQGTKLEIK` before the pipe and `QAQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTFSTYGMHWVRQAPGKGLEWVAVISYDGSNKYYADSVKGRFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRTEDTAVYYCGKQSYSSGWYLSVWGQGTLVTVSS` after the pipe.  This suggests two related sequences, possibly representing different parts of a protein or antibody.\n\n**Entry 2:** The entry with name `>3fca1100-9cd8-4a33-bc14-31deef613172|_A` contains a sequence string `EVQLLESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSSYAMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVSAISGSGGSTYYADSVKGRFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAKASSSSGNYWGQGTLVTVSS` before the pipe and `DIQMTQSPSTLSASVGDRVTITCRASQSISSWLAWYQQKPGKAPKLLIYKASSLESGVPSRFSGSGSGTEFTLTISSLQPDDFATYYCQQYNSYWTFGQGTKVEIK` after the pipe.  Again, this shows two sequences, possibly from different parts of the same protein or different proteins.\n\n**Entry 3:** The entry with name `>b6fdd5bd-97ed-4204-a0f0-d9b4eb0afa13|_A` contains a sequence string `QVQLQESGPGLVKPSQTLSLTCTVSGGSISSGSYYWSWIRQPAGKGLEWIGRIYTSGSTNYNPSLKSRVTISVDTSKNQFSLKLSSVTAADTAVYYCARDHFWSGYPNLERWFDPWGQGTLVTVSS` before the pipe and `EIVLTQSPGTLSLSPGERATLSCRASQSVSSSYLAWYQQKPGQAPRLLIYGASSRATGIPDRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISRLEPEDFAVYYCQQYGSSPLTFGGGTKVEIK` after the pipe. This also shows two sequences, similar to the previous entries.\n\n**Entry 4:** The entry with name `>3fca1100-9cd8-4a33-bc14-31deef613172|_B` contains the same sequences as entry 2, but in reversed order.\n\n**Entry 5:** The entry with name `>b6fdd5bd-97ed-4204-a0f0-d9b4eb0afa13|_B` contains the same sequences as entry 3, but in reversed order.\n\n\nThe \"_A\" and \"_B\" suffixes suggest that these might be paired sequences (e.g., heavy and light chains of an antibody). The sequences themselves appear to be amino acid sequences, possibly related to immunoglobulins or similar proteins.  Without further information or context, more specific interpretation is impossible.\n"
