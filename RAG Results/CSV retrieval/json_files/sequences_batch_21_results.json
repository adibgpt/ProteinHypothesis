This entry represents a sequence in the training dataset with unknown origin and gene information.\n\n\n**Row 2:** The row with name '128l' has chain 'A', gene 'E', organism 'Enterobacteria Phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4)', sequence 'MNIFEMLRIDEGLRLKIYKDTEGYYTIGIGHLLTKSPSLNAAKSELDKAIGRNTNGVITKDEAEKLFNQDVDAAVRGILRNAKLKPTYDSLDAVRRAALINMVFQMGETGVAGFTNSLRMLQQKRWDEAAVNLAKSRWYNQTPNRAKRVITTFRTGTWDAYKNL', belongs to the 'train' part of the dataset, and has UniProt ID 'P00720'. This row represents a protein sequence from gene E of Bacteriophage T4, used for training, with a known UniProt ID.\n\n\n**Row 3:** The row with name '129d' has chain 'A', no listed genes or organism, sequence 'CGCGAATTCGCG', belongs to the 'val' part of the dataset, and has no UniProt ID. This entry is a sequence in the validation dataset with unknown origin and gene information.\n\n\n**Row 4:** The row with name '128d' has chain 'A', no listed genes or organism, sequence 'CGCGAATTCGCG', belongs to the 'train' part of the dataset, and has no UniProt ID. This is a duplicate entry of row 1, a sequence in the training dataset with unknown origin and gene information.\n\n\n**Row 5:** The row with name '127l' has chain 'A', gene 'E', organism 'Enterobacteria Phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4)', sequence 'MNIFEMLRIDEGLRLKIYKDTEGYYTIGIGHLLTKSPSLNAAKSELDKAIGRNTNGVITKDEAEKLFNQDVDAATRGILRNAKLKPVYDSLDAVRRAALINMVFQMGETGVAGFTNSLRMLQQKRWDEAAVNLAKSRWYNQTPNRAKRVITTFRTGTWDAYKNL', belongs to the 'train' part of the dataset, and has UniProt ID 'P00720'. This row is similar to row 2, but with a slightly different sequence, also from gene E of Bacteriophage T4, used for training, with the same UniProt ID.  The slight sequence difference may indicate an error or variant.\n"
