This suggests a protein chain H from the 12e8 entry in a training dataset, characterized by the given amino acid sequence, lacking further annotation.\n\n**Row 2:** The row with name \"12gs\", chain \"A\", genes \"GSTP1 FAEES3 GST3\", organism \"Homo Sapiens (Human)\", has the sequence \"MPPYTVVYFPVRGRCAALRMLLADQGQSWKEEVVTVETWQEGSLKASCLYGQLPKFQDGDLTLYQSNTILRHLGRTLGLYGKDQQEAALVDMVNDGVEDLRCKYISLIYTNYEAGKDDYVKALPGQLKPFETLLSQNQGGKTFIVGDQISFADYNLLDLLLIHEVLAPGCLDAFPLLSAYVGRLSARPKLKAFLASPEYVNLPINGNGKQ\", belongs to the \"train\" part, and has UniProt ID \"P09211\". This represents a human GSTP1, FAEES3, and GST3 protein (chain A) from a training dataset, with the provided sequence and a known UniProt ID.\n\n**Row 3:** The row with name \"12e8\", chain \"P\", lacks gene and organism information, has sequence \"EVQLQQSGAEVVRSGASVKLSCTASGFNIKDYYIHWVKQRPEKGLEWIGWIDPEIGDTEYVPKFQGKATMTADTSSNTAYLQLSSLTSEDTAVYYCNAGHDYDRGRFPYWGQGTLVTVSAAKTTPPSVYPLAPGSAAQTNSMVTLGCLVKGYFPEPVTVTWNSGSLSSGVHTFPAVLQSDLYTLSSSVTVPSSTWPSETVTCNVAHPASSTKVDKKIVPRD\", belongs to the \"train\" part, and has no UniProt ID.  This is another chain (P) from the 12e8 entry, sharing the same sequence characteristics as the H chain (row 1) but lacking annotation.\n\n**Row 4:** The row with name \"12e8\", chain \"L\", lacks gene and organism information, has sequence \"DIVMTQSQKFMSTSVGDRVSITCKASQNVGTAVAWYQQKPGQSPKLMIYSASNRYTGVPDRFTGSGSGTDFTLTISNMQSEDLADYFCQQYSSYPLTFGAGTKLELKRADAAPTVSIFPPSSEQLTSGGASVVCFLNNFYPKDINVKWKIDGSERQNGVLNSATDQDSKDSTYSMSSTLTLTKDEYERHNSYTCEATHKTSTSPIVKSFNRNEC\", belongs to the \"train\" part, and has no UniProt ID. This is chain L from the 12e8 entry, with a different sequence than chains H and P, again lacking annotation.\n\n**Row 5:** The row with name \"12e8\", chain \"M\", lacks gene and organism information, has sequence \"DIVMTQSQKFMSTSVGDRVSITCKASQNVGTAVAWYQQKPGQSPKLMIYSASNRYTGVPDRFTGSGSGTDFTLTISNMQSEDLADYFCQQYSSYPLTFGAGTKLELKRADAAPTVSIFPPSSEQLTSGGASVVCFLNNFYPKDINVKWKIDGSERQNGVLNSATDQDSKDSTYSMSSTLTLTKDEYERHNSYTCEATHKTSTSPIVKSFNRNEC\", belongs to the \"train\" part, and has no UniProt ID. This row is identical to row 4, suggesting a duplicate or error in the data.\n\n\n"
