        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00255 426, depth: 2.824190311, absolute_sasa: 3.214377072, hse_up: 19, hse_down: 22, coord_number: 41, rsa: 0.011976048, h_nho1: -2.4, h_ohn1: -1.1, h_nho2: -0.2, h_ohn2: -0.3, tco: 0.941, kappa: 113.2, alpha: 46.2, phi: -61.2, psi: -49.2, struct_motif: H, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0.285714286, acidic: 0.285714286, polar: 0.142857143, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.142857143, aliphatic: 0.142857143, aromatic: 0, KB05: 33.45381183, KB03: 31.92385948, KB02: 23.9371404\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Site O00255 at position 426 exhibits a depth of 2.82, a relatively low solvent-accessible surface area (3.21), and a coordination number of 41, suggesting a buried residue with moderate interaction.  Its relatively low RSA (0.012) and negative H-bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1) indicate a lack of exposure and potential hydrogen bonding interactions, further supported by its structural motif \u2018H\u2019 and a positive TCO value (0.941). The relatively high kappa value (113.2) suggests a certain degree of rigidity in the backbone conformation.  The site is not located in a pocket and is not at an interface. Its amino acid composition includes balanced basic and acidic residues, and a small proportion of polar, structural, and aliphatic residues.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue appears to be deeply buried within the protein structure, with limited solvent exposure and a defined secondary structure (H-helix).  The balanced amino acid composition suggests a possible role in structural integrity rather than specific binding interactions.\n\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00267 638, depth: 2.295644943, absolute_sasa: 6.117309215, hse_up: 26, hse_down: 17, coord_number: 43, rsa: 0.053892216, h_nho1: -2.1, h_ohn1: -1.7, h_nho2: -0.4, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: -0.98, kappa: 37.3, alpha: -104.9, phi: -135.9, psi: 148.1, struct_motif: E, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0.333333333, acidic: 0, polar: 0, cysteine: 0, structural: 0, aliphatic: 0.666666667, aromatic: 0, KB05: 48.33224036, KB03: 46.94574492, KB02: 30.62619156\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Site O00267 at position 638 has a moderate depth (2.30) and solvent-accessible surface area (6.12), along with a high coordination number (43), suggesting a partially exposed residue with many interactions.  Its negative TCO (-0.98) and low kappa value (37.3) indicate a flexible region with potential for conformational changes.  The high percentage of aliphatic residues (66.7%) and the structural motif \u2018E\u2019 (likely beta-sheet) provide insights into its local environment and secondary structure.  It is not in a pocket or at an interface.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue is partially exposed to the solvent and is characterized by flexibility and a high proportion of aliphatic residues.  Its location outside pockets and interfaces suggests a predominantly structural role.\n\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00255 359, depth: 2.459450861, absolute_sasa: 4.909680999, hse_up: 14, hse_down: 16, coord_number: 30, rsa: 0.023952096, h_nho1: -0.5, h_ohn1: -1.9, h_nho2: -0.1, h_ohn2: -0.1, tco: -0.657, kappa: 40.5, alpha: -93.1, phi: -108.8, psi: 162.7, struct_motif: N/A, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0.25, acidic: 0.25, acidic: 0.25, polar: 0.25, cysteine: 0, structural: 0, aliphatic: 0, aromatic: 0.25, KB05: 21.88399078, KB03: 27.96997332, KB02: 20.19934767\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Site O00255 at position 359 shows a moderate depth (2.46) and solvent-accessible surface area (4.91), with a coordination number of 30, indicating a partially buried residue.  Its negative TCO (-0.657) and low kappa (40.5) suggest some flexibility.  The absence of a defined secondary structure (struct_motif: N/A) is notable.  The amino acid composition includes equal proportions of basic, acidic, polar, and aromatic residues.  It is not located in a pocket or at an interface.\n\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue is partially buried and flexible, lacking a defined secondary structure.  Its balanced amino acid composition suggests a possible role in mediating interactions or maintaining local structural integrity.\n\n\n**Row 4:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00267 429, depth: 1.959152552, absolute_sasa: 53.77753172, hse_up: 13, hse_down: 10, coord_number: 23, rsa: 0.317365269, h_nho1: -2.9, h_ohn1: -0.3, h_nho2: -0.6, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: 0.623, kappa: 64.2, alpha: 8.3, phi: -84.2, psi: -21, struct_motif: N/A, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0.6, polar: 0, cysteine: 0, structural: 0, aliphatic: 0.4, aromatic: 0, KB05: 16.72795935, KB03: 25.51197599, KB02: 10.7646345\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Site O00267 at position 429 is characterized by a shallow depth (1.96) and a significantly high solvent-accessible surface area (53.78), along with a low coordination number (23), indicating a highly exposed residue with limited interactions.  Its positive TCO (0.623) and moderate kappa value (64.2) suggest a relatively rigid conformation.  The high proportion of acidic residues (60%) is notable. It is not located in a pocket or at an interface and lacks a defined secondary structure (struct_motif: N/A).\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue is highly exposed to the solvent and dominated by acidic residues.  Its location on the surface suggests a potential role in interactions with other molecules or the surrounding environment.\n\n\n**Row 5:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00267 626, depth: 2.170261258, absolute_sasa: 30.48727175, hse_up: 14, hse_down: 15, coord_number: 29, rsa: 0.173652695, h_nho1: -1.9, h_ohn1: -1.5, h_nho2: -0.4, h_ohn2: -0.1, tco: -0.953, kappa: 22.9, alpha: -150.8, phi: -137.3, psi: 122.6, struct_motif: N/A, pocket: 0, interface: TRUE, basic: 0.6, acidic: 0, polar: 0, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.2, aliphatic: 0.2, aromatic: 0, KB05: 44.87901261, KB03: 68.90313537, KB02: 55.86441431\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Site O00267 at position 626 has a moderate depth (2.17) and a relatively high solvent-accessible surface area (30.49), with a coordination number of 29.  Its negative TCO (-0.953) and very low kappa value (22.9) indicate a highly flexible region.  This residue is located at a protein interface, as indicated by the `interface: TRUE` value.  The amino acid composition is dominated by basic residues (60%).\n\n3. **Summary Statement:**  This highly flexible residue is located at a protein interface and is characterized by a high proportion of basic residues, suggesting a potential role in intermolecular interactions.\n"
