        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1:**  Site O14920 residue 464, located at a depth of 2.24, has an accessible surface area of 56.06, with 11 hydrogen bonds up and 12 down, resulting in a coordination number of 23 and a relative surface area of 0.32.  Its backbone dihedral angles (phi and psi) are -65.6 and -37.9 respectively, suggesting an H secondary structure.  The site shows a low propensity to be in a pocket and is not at an interface, with a relatively high KB05 value (54.73). This suggests a relatively exposed, but structurally important residue with potential interactions.\n\n\n**Row 2:** Site O14893 residue 63, at a depth of 1.90 and surface area of 31.52, shows 19 hydrogen bonds up and 3 down (coordination number 22), and a relative surface area of 0.46. Its backbone dihedral angles (-82.7 and 141) indicate a sheet (S) secondary structure. This residue is located within a pocket (127.25) and is at an interface, indicating a potential role in protein-protein interactions, evidenced by comparatively low KB05 (11.51).\n\n\n**Row 3:** Site O14920 residue 524, has a depth of 1.81 and a small accessible surface area of 11.63, with 19 hydrogen bonds up and 9 down (coordination number 28), and a low relative surface area of 0.05.  Its dihedral angles (-96.4 and 162) do not correspond to a defined secondary structure (N/A), and it is not in a pocket or at an interface.  The residue shows moderate KB05 (39.38) and is characterized by a balanced distribution of basic and acidic properties. This suggests a buried residue with potential interactions within the protein core.\n\n\n**Row 4:** Site O14920 residue 299, located at a depth of 3.97, has a completely buried accessible surface area of 0, with a high number of hydrogen bonds (26 up and 14 down), leading to a coordination number of 40.  Its dihedral angles (-69.4 and -27.5) suggest an H secondary structure.  It is not in a pocket or at an interface, and exhibits a high KB05 value (67.87). This strongly suggests a deeply buried residue with significant structural role.\n\n\n**Row 5:** Site O14893 residue 148, located at a depth of 3.37, has a very small accessible surface area of 2.14, with 22 hydrogen bonds up and 13 down (coordination number 35), and a very low relative surface area of 0.01.  Its dihedral angles (-75.1 and -43) indicate an H secondary structure.  This residue is not in a pocket or at an interface, and shows a relatively moderate KB05 value (30.82).  The high aromatic character suggests a potential role in hydrophobic interactions.\n\n\nNote:  The interpretation of KB05, KB03, and KB02 values requires additional context about their meaning within the data source.  Without this context, only relative comparisons within the dataset are possible.\n"
