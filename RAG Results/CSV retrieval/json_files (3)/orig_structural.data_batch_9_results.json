        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as text, not a true CSV, so the analysis is based on the interpretation of the provided text.\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00194 188):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00194 188), depth (1.87), absolute_sasa (50.34), hse_up (10), hse_down (4), coord_number (14), rsa (0.27), h_nho1 (-1), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.55), kappa (86.6), alpha (118.5), phi (-95.3), psi (-5.1), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0.25), cysteine (0.25), structural (0), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0), KB05 (36.81), KB03 (25.92), KB02 (27.99).\n\nSentence description:  Site O00194 at residue 188 shows a depth of 1.87 units, a relatively high solvent-accessible surface area (50.34),  a low coordination number (14), and moderate RSA (0.27), suggesting a partially exposed location with limited interactions;  hydrogen bond parameters (h_nho1, h_ohn1, etc.) indicate weak hydrogen bonding, and the structural motif is classified as H;  the residue is neither basic nor acidic, has some polar and cysteine characteristics, and is predominantly aliphatic; KB values suggest moderate interaction energies.\n\n\nSummary: This residue is moderately exposed on the protein surface with a somewhat limited number of contacts, suggesting it may be involved in interactions that don't involve extensive hydrogen bonding.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00204 104):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00204 104), depth (2.07), absolute_sasa (13.83), hse_up (23), hse_down (16), coord_number (39), rsa (0.07), h_nho1 (-2), h_ohn1 (-0.1), h_nho2 (-0.3), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (0.95), kappa (92.7), alpha (46.7), phi (-58.2), psi (-58.3), struct_motif (S), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.25), polar (0.25), cysteine (0), structural (0.25), aliphatic (0.25), aromatic (0), KB05 (14.54), KB03 (21.63), KB02 (12.23).\n\nSentence description: Site O00204 at residue 104 is buried deeper (depth 2.07) with a low solvent-accessible surface area (13.83) and high coordination number (39), suggesting a highly packed environment;  it has a low RSA (0.07), and its hydrogen bonding is moderate to weak, with a structural motif classified as S;  the residue exhibits some acidic and polar character and is a mixture of structural and aliphatic components; its KB values suggest weaker interactions compared to the first row.\n\nSummary:  This residue is deeply buried within the protein, highly interacting with its environment, and exhibits a mix of chemical properties.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00204 225):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00204 225), depth (2.52), absolute_sasa (4.83), hse_up (20), hse_down (12), coord_number (32), rsa (0.03), h_nho1 (-1.3), h_ohn1 (-1.6), h_nho2 (-0.3), h_ohn2 (-0.8), tco (0.96), kappa (107.4), alpha (48.1), phi (-73.2), psi (-54.1), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0.6), aliphatic (0.4), aromatic (0), KB05 (39.68), KB03 (42.97), KB02 (31.07).\n\nSentence description:  Residue 225 at site O00204 is deeply buried (depth 2.52) with a very low solvent-accessible surface area (4.83) and a relatively high coordination number (32), indicating a tightly packed core region; it shows a very low RSA (0.03), weak hydrogen bonding, and a structural motif classified as H;  it is primarily structural and aliphatic, and its KB values suggest relatively strong interactions.\n\nSummary: This highly buried residue is likely crucial for maintaining the protein's core structure due to its numerous interactions and low surface exposure.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00212 119):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00212 119), depth (1.83), absolute_sasa (52.68), hse_up (14), hse_down (3), coord_number (17), rsa (0.29), h_nho1 (-1), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.3), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.46), kappa (68.9), alpha (178.5), phi (-82.8), psi (-8.8), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.4), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.4), aromatic (0.2), KB05 (55.22), KB03 (56.85), KB02 (35.94).\n\nSentence description: Site O00212 at residue 119 exhibits a moderate depth (1.83), a high solvent-accessible surface area (52.68), and a moderate coordination number (17), suggesting a surface-exposed location with some interactions; it displays moderate RSA (0.29) and weak hydrogen bonds, a missing structural motif classification, and is partially basic, aliphatic, and aromatic, while lacking polar character; its KB values suggest strong interactions.\n\nSummary: This residue is located on the protein surface, is partially basic and aromatic, and despite having a high solvent accessibility, it seems to participate in strong interactions.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00204 278):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00204 278), depth (1.83), absolute_sasa (70.74), hse_up (9), hse_down (20), coord_number (29), rsa (0.41), h_nho1 (-0.3), h_ohn1 (0), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (0), tco (-0.68), kappa (96.5), alpha (5.5), phi (-85.3), psi (129.5), struct_motif (T), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0.5), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0), KB05 (40.81), KB03 (43.25), KB02 (38.37).\n\nSentence description:  Residue 278 at site O00204 has a moderate depth (1.83), a high solvent-accessible surface area (70.74), and a moderate coordination number (29), indicating a partially exposed location; it shows high RSA (0.41), weak hydrogen bonding, and a structural motif classified as T;  it's a mixture of structural and aliphatic components, and its KB values suggest strong interactions.\n\nSummary: This relatively exposed residue displays strong interactions despite its high surface accessibility, possibly indicating a role in binding or interaction with other molecules.\n"
