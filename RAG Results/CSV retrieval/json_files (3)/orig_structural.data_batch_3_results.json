        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: A5YKK6 1420):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A5YKK6 1420), depth (6.89), absolute_sasa (0), hse_up (27), hse_down (19), coord_number (46), rsa (0), h_nho1 (-2.4), h_ohn1 (-2.6), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.3), tco (0.94), kappa (113.5), alpha (50.6), phi (-65.2), psi (-44.6), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (TRUE), basic (0), acidic (0.2), polar (0.2), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.6), aromatic (0), KB05 (54.98), KB03 (60.10), KB02 (37.72).\n\nDescriptive sentence:  Site A5YKK6 1420, located at a depth of 6.89 with a completely buried surface area (absolute_sasa = 0) and a high coordination number (46), exhibits a hydrogen-bonding pattern indicated by h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, and h_ohn2 values; it has a significant number of HSE interactions (hse_up: 27, hse_down: 19), forms part of an interface (interface: TRUE), and possesses predominantly aliphatic character (aliphatic: 0.6) with a struct_motif classified as H, suggesting a helical conformation.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 values indicate significant interaction energies.\n\nSummary: This residue is deeply buried, highly coordinated, and involved in an interface, exhibiting characteristics consistent with a core structural element within a protein.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: A2RUC4 257):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A2RUC4 257), depth (2.10), absolute_sasa (37.91), hse_up (16), hse_down (10), coord_number (26), rsa (0.28), h_nho1 (-3.7), h_ohn1 (-1.4), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.6), tco (0.67), kappa (89), alpha (77.4), phi (-59.9), psi (-19.8), struct_motif (G), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.2), polar (0.2), cysteine (0), structural (0.2), aliphatic (0.2), aromatic (0.2), KB05 (17.02), KB03 (18.19), KB02 (13.60).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site A2RUC4 257, situated at a shallower depth (2.10) with a relatively exposed surface area (absolute_sasa = 37.91) and a moderate coordination number (26), reveals a less extensive hydrogen-bonding network compared to A5YKK6 1420, as indicated by the h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, and h_ohn2 values; it is not part of an interface (interface: FALSE), and displays a more balanced distribution of structural, aliphatic, and aromatic characteristics (structural: 0.2, aliphatic: 0.2, aromatic: 0.2) with a struct_motif of G, suggesting a Glycine residue in a loop or turn. Lower KB values suggest weaker interaction energies.\n\nSummary: This residue is more exposed to solvent and less involved in interactions compared to the first residue; its properties are consistent with a more flexible, surface-exposed region of a protein.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: A4D1P6 596):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A4D1P6 596), depth (1.91), absolute_sasa (36.87), hse_up (16), hse_down (11), coord_number (27), rsa (0.19), h_nho1 (-0.4), h_ohn1 (-0.3), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (-0.31), kappa (13.6), alpha (-136.2), phi (-72.7), psi (151.4), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.25), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0.25), KB05 (26.72), KB03 (26.83), KB02 (16.32).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site A4D1P6 596 shows a surface location (depth 1.91, absolute_sasa 36.87), moderate coordination number (27), and weak hydrogen bonding interactions (h_nho1 to h_ohn2 values are all near zero); its unusual backbone dihedral angles (alpha = -136.2, phi = -72.7, psi = 151.4) and negative tco value (-0.31) suggest a distorted conformation, possibly in a loop or turn; it\u2019s not at an interface and is characterized by aliphatic and aromatic components (aliphatic: 0.5, aromatic: 0.25), and lacks a defined structural motif (struct_motif: N/A).\n\nSummary: This residue is surface-exposed with weak interactions and a significantly distorted conformation, possibly reflecting a flexible region of the protein.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: A5YKK6 1287):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A5YKK6 1287), depth (2.82), absolute_sasa (3.62), hse_up (16), hse_down (17), coord_number (33), rsa (0.01), h_nho1 (-2.4), h_ohn1 (-2.8), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.4), tco (0.94), kappa (108.9), alpha (47.1), phi (-54.9), psi (-49.2), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.2), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.8), aromatic (0), KB05 (61.36), KB03 (62.99), KB02 (38.41).\n\nDescriptive sentence:  Site A5YKK6 1287 is relatively shallow (depth 2.82) with a small exposed surface area (absolute_sasa = 3.62), exhibiting a moderate coordination number (33);  it displays some hydrogen bonding (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) and is primarily aliphatic (aliphatic: 0.8) with a helical struct_motif (H), although it is not part of an interface.  It has a small basic component (basic: 0.2).  High KB values suggest strong interaction energies.\n\nSummary: This residue is partially buried, predominantly aliphatic, and likely part of a helical structure with strong interactions, despite not being at an interface.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: A4D1P6 487):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A4D1P6 487), depth (1.95), absolute_sasa (44.27), hse_up (4), hse_down (14), coord_number (18), rsa (0.28), h_nho1 (-0.9), h_ohn1 (-2.5), h_nho2 (0), h_ohn2 (-0.5), tco (-0.96), kappa (50), alpha (-127.4), phi (-164.1), psi (156.6), struct_motif (E), struct_motif (E), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.33), acidic (0.33), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.67), aromatic (0), KB05 (44.56), KB03 (38.48), KB02 (22.58).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site A4D1P6 487 is located near the surface (depth 1.95, absolute_sasa 44.27) with a low coordination number (18), indicating fewer direct interactions;  it has a relatively high acidic component (acidic: 0.33) and is mainly aliphatic (aliphatic: 0.67) with a distinct extended strand struct_motif (E) and negative tco value (-0.96), suggesting a less ordered conformation; it's not part of an interface.\n\nSummary: This surface-exposed residue is characterized by a low coordination number, a high acidic component, and an extended conformation, possibly indicating a flexible loop or turn.\n"
