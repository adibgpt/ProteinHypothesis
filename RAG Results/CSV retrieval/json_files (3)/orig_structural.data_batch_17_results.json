        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a CSV file, but I will treat it as such for the purpose of this answer.\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00410 473):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00410 473), depth (2.6788), absolute_sasa (9.9946), hse_up (24), hse_down (9), coord_number (33), rsa (0.0479), h_nho1 (-1.1), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (-0.697), kappa (71.7), alpha (-115.8), phi (-85.5), psi (129.5), struct_motif (S), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.2), polar (0.4), cysteine (0), structural (0.2), aliphatic (0), aromatic (0.2), KB05 (47.2481), KB03 (61.8303), KB02 (39.2886).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00410 473, located at a depth of 2.68 units with a relatively low solvent-accessible surface area (9.99), has 24 hydrogen bonds upwards and 9 downwards, a coordination number of 33, and a low relative solvent accessibility (0.048), suggesting a buried location; its backbone dihedral angles (phi=-85.5, psi=129.5) indicate a structural motif S, with a negative torsion angle (tco=-0.697) and other characteristics indicating it's non-interfacial, moderately polar (0.4), and contains some acidic (0.2) and aromatic (0.2) residues.\n\nSummary: This residue is deeply buried within the protein structure, characterized by a low solvent accessibility and a unique structural motif (S), likely playing a key role in maintaining protein stability.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00410 348):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00410 348), depth (1.9635), absolute_sasa (59.1127), hse_up (12), hse_down (18), coord_number (30), rsa (0.3234), h_nho1 (-2.4), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.911), kappa (117.2), alpha (47), phi (-66), psi (-46.6), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.2), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0.6), aliphatic (0.2), aromatic (0), KB05 (48.5862), KB03 (57.1814), KB02 (38.6214).\n\nDescriptive sentence:  Site O00410 348, at a depth of 1.96 units, shows a significantly higher solvent-accessible surface area (59.11) compared to the previous site, with 12 upward and 18 downward hydrogen bonds, a coordination number of 30, and a higher relative solvent accessibility (0.32), indicating a more exposed location; its backbone dihedral angles (phi=-66, psi=-46.6) suggest a helical (H) structure, with a positive torsion angle (tco=0.911) and  a composition predominantly structural (0.6) and slightly aliphatic (0.2) and acidic (0.2).\n\nSummary: This residue is more surface-exposed than the previous one, exhibiting a helical secondary structure and a higher degree of structural character.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00410 266):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00410 266), depth (3.3111), absolute_sasa (2.4944), hse_up (25), hse_down (16), coord_number (41), rsa (0.0120), h_nho1 (-1.6), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.869), kappa (115.1), alpha (48.4), phi (-61.7), psi (-42), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.1667), acidic (0), polar (0.1667), cysteine (0), structural (0.1667), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0), KB05 (54.9174), KB03 (49.8418), KB02 (32.3147).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00410 266, found at a depth of 3.31 units with a very low solvent-accessible surface area (2.49), has 25 upward and 16 downward hydrogen bonds, a high coordination number (41), and a low relative solvent accessibility (0.012), suggesting a buried position; its backbone dihedral angles (phi=-61.7, psi=-42) conform to a helical (H) structure, with a positive torsion angle (tco=0.869) and a composition characterized by a significant aliphatic (0.5) content and small fractions of basic, polar, and structural residues.\n\nSummary:  This residue is deeply buried, despite having a helical structure, indicating a possible role in core packing or interactions with other buried residues.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00410 560):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00410 560), depth (4.7681), absolute_sasa (0), hse_up (22), hse_down (17), coord_number (39), rsa (0), h_nho1 (-1.8), h_ohn1 (-1.3), h_ohn2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.942), kappa (113), alpha (48.6), phi (-62.6), psi (-46.9), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.125), polar (0.25), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.625), aromatic (0), KB05 (55.1419), KB03 (59.7194), KB02 (21.8759).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00410 560, located at a depth of 4.77 units with a completely buried solvent-accessible surface area (0), has 22 upward and 17 downward hydrogen bonds, a coordination number of 39, and zero relative solvent accessibility, indicating a completely buried location;  its backbone dihedral angles (phi=-62.6, psi=-46.9) indicate a helical (H) structure, with a positive torsion angle (tco=0.942) and is primarily composed of aliphatic (0.625) residues and a small fraction of acidic (0.125) and polar (0.25) residues.\n\nSummary: This is a highly buried residue with a helical structure, primarily composed of aliphatic amino acids, likely contributing significantly to the protein's hydrophobic core.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00410 420):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00410 420), depth (2.7699), absolute_sasa (2.1429), hse_up (22), hse_down (26), coord_number (48), rsa (0), h_nho1 (-1.5), h_ohn1 (-2.7), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.9), kappa (111.2), alpha (48.2), phi (-55.7), psi (-45.9), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.125), acidic (0), polar (0.125), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.625), aromatic (0.125), KB05 (50.7708), KB03 (55.4531), KB02 (38.9590).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00410 420, at a depth of 2.77 units with a very low solvent-accessible surface area (2.14), has 22 upward and 26 downward hydrogen bonds, a high coordination number (48), and zero relative solvent accessibility, indicating it's deeply buried; its backbone dihedral angles (phi=-55.7, psi=-45.9) suggest a helical (H) structure, with a positive torsion angle (tco=0.9) and a composition mainly aliphatic (0.625), with small fractions of basic and aromatic residues.\n\nSummary: Similar to site 560, this residue is deeply buried and primarily aliphatic, contributing to the hydrophobic core of the protein.  The high coordination number suggests a significant number of interactions with neighboring residues.\n"
