        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a CSV file.  Therefore,  \"column names\" are replaced with \"feature names\".\n\n\n**Row 1: site: O14727 675**\n\nFeature Names and Values: site (O14727 675), depth (4.744), absolute_sasa (2.380), hse_up (23), hse_down (24), coord_number (47), rsa (0), h_nho1 (-2.6), h_ohn1 (-2.1), h_nho2 (-0.4), h_ohn2 (-0.5), tco (-1), kappa (20.6), alpha (167.2), phi (-134.6), psi (138.9), struct_motif (E), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0.286), cysteine (0.286), structural (0), aliphatic (0.429), aromatic (0), KB05 (19.157), KB03 (11.162), KB02 (7.138).\n\nDescription: Site O14727 residue 675 is buried deep (depth 4.744) with low solvent accessibility (absolute_sasa 2.380), exhibiting a high coordination number (47) and predominantly aliphatic character (0.429).  Its secondary structure is an extended strand (E), and it lacks interactions at the interface. The hydrogen bonding and torsion angles suggest a specific conformation.\n\nSummary: This residue is deeply buried within the protein core, characterized by its high coordination number and lack of surface exposure, indicating a potentially important structural role.\n\n\n**Row 2: site: O14732 259**\n\nFeature Names and Values: site (O14732 259), depth (1.972), absolute_sasa (50.069), hse_up (9), hse_down (19), coord_number (28), rsa (0.257), h_nho1 (-0.2), h_ohn1 (-1.7), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-1.6), tco (0.721), kappa (70.6), alpha (86), phi (30), psi (43.1), struct_motif (S), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.25), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0.25), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0), KB05 (22.630), KB03 (35.512), KB02 (2.945).\n\nDescription: Site O14732 residue 259 is located at a shallower depth (1.972) with significantly higher solvent accessibility (absolute_sasa 50.069) compared to the previous residue, indicating a more surface-exposed location.  It has a lower coordination number (28) and is characterized by a significant proportion of aliphatic and basic residues. The secondary structure is a strand (S).\n\nSummary: This residue is significantly more exposed to the solvent than the first, suggesting a potential role in protein-protein interactions or ligand binding, given its basic character.\n\n\n**Row 3: site: O14727 761**\n\nFeature Names and Values: site (O14727 761), depth (4.349), absolute_sasa (8.849), hse_up (19), hse_down (29), coord_number (48), rsa (0.030), h_nho1 (-3), h_ohn1 (-2.3), h_nho2 (-0.5), h_ohn2 (-1.2), tco (-0.935), kappa (16.9), alpha (173.3), phi (-115.1), psi (138.8), struct_motif (E), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.2), acidic (0), polar (0.6), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.2), aromatic (0), KB05 (25.665), KB03 (21.383), KB02 (12.376).\n\nDescription:  Site O14727 residue 761 shows intermediate depth (4.349) and moderate solvent accessibility (absolute_sasa 8.849), a high coordination number (48), and a high proportion of polar residues (0.6). Its secondary structure is an extended strand (E).\n\nSummary: This residue shows a balance between buried and exposed characteristics, possibly playing a role in mediating interactions within the protein or with the surrounding environment due to its polar nature.\n\n\n**Row 4: site: O14732 152**\n\nFeature Names and Values: site (O14732 152), depth (2.255), absolute_sasa (12.710), hse_up (14), hse_down (16), coord_number (30), rsa (0.054), h_nho1 (-0.9), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.3), h_ohn2 (0), tco (-0.97), kappa (89.7), alpha (-26.2), phi (-132.1), psi (112.9), struct_motif (E), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0.333), cysteine (0), structural (0.167), aliphatic (0.167), aromatic (0.333), KB05 (3.877), KB03 (17.999), KB02 (6.583).\n\nDescription: Site O14732 residue 152 has a relatively shallow depth (2.255) and low solvent accessibility (absolute_sasa 12.710), a moderate coordination number (30), and a mix of polar and aromatic residues.  Its secondary structure is an extended strand (E).\n\nSummary: This residue displays a moderate level of exposure, with a notable proportion of aromatic residues, potentially indicating involvement in interactions with other aromatic groups within the protein.\n\n\n**Row 5: site: O14727 633**\n\nFeature Names and Values: site (O14727 633), depth (5.372), absolute_sasa (0), hse_up (24), hse_down (19), coord_number (43), rsa (0), h_nho1 (-2.8), h_ohn1 (-2.1), h_nho2 (-0.3), h_ohn2 (-2), tco (-0.972), kappa (15), alpha (132.4), phi (-150), psi (160.1), struct_motif (E), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.2), acidic (0), polar (0.2), cysteine (0.2), structural (0.2), aliphatic (0.2), aromatic (0), KB05 (21.934), KB03 (24.387), KB02 (17.304).\n\nDescription: Site O14727 residue 633 is deeply buried (depth 5.372) with no solvent accessibility (absolute_sasa 0), possessing a high coordination number (43) and a relatively even distribution of residue types. Its secondary structure is an extended strand (E).\n\nSummary: This residue is completely buried within the protein core, suggesting a critical structural role in maintaining the protein's overall conformation.\n"
