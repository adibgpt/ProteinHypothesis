        "response": "The provided data consists of rows with the following columns: `protein_id`, `protein_sequence`, `mutant`, `mutated_sequence`, and `annotation`.  Each row represents a specific mutation in a protein (NP_000007.1) where the `protein_sequence` shows the original amino acid sequence, the `mutant` column specifies the amino acid change (e.g., D104G means Aspartic acid at position 104 is changed to Glycine), the `mutated_sequence` displays the altered sequence after the mutation, and the `annotation` indicates the effect of the mutation as \"Pathogenic\".  For example, in one row, the protein with ID NP_000007.1 has its original sequence mutated from Aspartic acid at position 104 to Glycine, resulting in a pathogenic mutated sequence.  All provided mutations in this dataset are annotated as pathogenic.\n"
