        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is not in CSV format, but I will treat each block of data as a separate row.\n\n**Row 1:** site: O14786 661; depth: 1.808; absolute_sasa: 52.43; hse_up: 21; hse_down: 8; coord_number: 29; rsa: 0.26; h_nho1: -0.3; h_ohn1: -0.4; h_nho2: 0; h_ohn2: -0.1; tco: -0.43; kappa: 71.6; alpha: -27.2; phi: 60.9; psi: -128.6; struct_motif: T; pocket: 0; interface: FALSE; basic: 0.2; acidic: 0; polar: 0.2; cysteine: 0.2; structural: 0.2; aliphatic: 0; aromatic: 0.2; KB05: 40.19; KB03: 41.48; KB02: 34.30.  Site O14786, residue 661, exhibits a relatively shallow depth (1.81) and a high accessible surface area (52.43), suggesting exposure to the solvent, with 21 hydrogen bonds pointing upwards and 8 downwards, contributing to its coordination number of 29 and RSA of 0.26. The hydrogen bond energies (h_nho1, h_ohn1, etc.) indicate moderate hydrogen bonding interactions, and the structural motif is 'T'.  It's not part of a pocket or interface, and displays a balanced composition of basic, polar, cysteine, and aromatic properties. KB values suggest moderate interaction energies.  The relatively high absolute_sasa and low depth indicate a surface-exposed residue.\n\n\n**Row 2:** site: O14802 1154; depth: 2.07; absolute_sasa: 20.92; hse_up: 11; hse_down: 14; coord_number: 25; rsa: 0.25; h_nho1: -0.2; h_ohn1: -0.5; h_ohn2: -0.1; h_ohn2: -0.2; tco: 0.27; kappa: 85.9; alpha: 100.6; phi: 76.7; psi: -4.1; struct_motif: S; pocket: 0; interface: TRUE; basic: 0; acidic: 0; polar: 0.33; cysteine: 0; structural: 0; aliphatic: 0.67; aromatic: 0; KB05: 14.66; KB03: 14.58; KB02: 9.96. Site O14802, residue 1154, shows a slightly deeper position (2.07) with a lower accessible surface area (20.92), indicating less solvent exposure.  It participates in an interface, as indicated by the 'interface: TRUE' value, and has a predominantly aliphatic character. The lower KB values suggest weaker interactions compared to Row 1.\n\n\n**Row 3:** site: O14773 122; depth: 3.64; absolute_sasa: 0; hse_up: 17; hse_down: 15; coord_number: 32; rsa: 0; h_nho1: -2.5; h_ohn1: -2.2; h_nho2: -0.5; h_ohn2: -0.5; tco: -0.88; kappa: 31.5; alpha: -122.9; phi: -129; psi: 158.3; struct_motif: E; pocket: 0; interface: FALSE; basic: 0; acidic: 0; polar: 0.2; cysteine: 0.2; structural: 0; aliphatic: 0.4; aromatic: 0.2; KB05: 57.08; KB03: 60.43; KB02: 44.29.  Site O14773, residue 122, is deeply buried (depth 3.64) with no accessible surface area, suggesting a significant role in the protein core.  Strong hydrogen bonds are indicated by the low h_nho and h_ohn values, and it forms part of a structural motif 'E'.  It is not located in a pocket or interface. The higher KB values suggest stronger interactions.\n\n\n**Row 4:** site: O14773 365; depth: 1.82; absolute_sasa: 57.53; hse_up: 12; hse_down: 22; coord_number: 34; rsa: 0.32; h_nho1: -0.2; h_ohn1: -0.5; h_nho2: -0.2; h_ohn2: -0.2; tco: -0.92; kappa: 32.8; alpha: 178; phi: -148.2; psi: 123.8; struct_motif: N/A; pocket: 0; interface: FALSE; basic: 0.33; acidic: 0; polar: 0; cysteine: 0.33; structural: 0.33; aliphatic: 0; aromatic: 0; KB05: 57.08; KB03: 60.43; KB02: 44.29. Site O14773, residue 365, has a shallow depth (1.82) and high accessible surface area (57.53), indicating solvent exposure.  It has a notable proportion of basic and cysteine residues and is not part of a defined structural motif or an interface.  The KB values are high, consistent with Row 3.\n\n\n**Row 5:** site: O14802 1174; depth: 2.73; absolute_sasa: 11.58; hse_up: 12; hse_down: 25; coord_number: 37; rsa: 0.07; h_nho1: -1.5; h_ohn1: -1.6; h_nho2: -0.3; h_ohn2: -0.7; tco: -0.99; kappa: 3.1; alpha: -159.1; phi: -135.1; psi: 132; struct_motif: E; pocket: 0; interface: TRUE; basic: 0; acidic: 0; polar: 0; cysteine: 0; structural: 0; aliphatic: 1; aromatic: 0; KB05: 15.03; KB03: 8.49; KB02: 3.45. Site O14802, residue 1174, shows intermediate depth (2.73) and low accessible surface area (11.58), suggesting partial burial.  It participates in an interface and is primarily aliphatic.  The very low kappa value and strong negative hydrogen bond energies suggest a tightly packed environment.  The low KB values suggest weaker interactions than other rows.\n"
