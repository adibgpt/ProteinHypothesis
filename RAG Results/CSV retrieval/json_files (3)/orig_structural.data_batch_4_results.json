The lack of solvent accessibility and strong hydrogen bonds support this interpretation.\n\n\n**Row 2: site: A6NHR9 444**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A6NHR9 444), depth (1.854015673), absolute_sasa (50.86716028), hse_up (10), hse_down (5), coord_number (15), rsa (0.275449102), h_nho1 (-0.3), h_ohn1 (0), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (0), tco (0.761), kappa (106.8), alpha (48.2), phi (-70), psi (-23.4), struct_motif (T), pocket (1218.125), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.25), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0.5), structural (0.5), aliphatic (0), aromatic (0.25), KB05 (45.06421214), KB03 (67.55390372), KB02 (33.63300741).\n\nDescription: Site A6NHR9 444 shows a relatively exposed residue (absolute_sasa 50.87, depth 1.85) with a lower coordination number (15), located in a pocket (pocket 1218.125), characterized by a turn structure (struct_motif T) and containing  acidic and aromatic components (acidic 0.25, aromatic 0.25). It is not located at an interface (interface FALSE).\n\nSummary: This residue is surface-exposed and located within a pocket, suggesting a potential role in ligand binding or protein-protein interactions. The presence of acidic and aromatic components may contribute to these interactions.\n\n\n**Row 3: site: A5YKK6 1541**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A5YKK6 1541), depth (1.964044556), absolute_sasa (20.50148074), hse_up (15), hse_down (18), coord_number (33), rsa (0.149700599), h_nho1 (-0.2), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (-0.947), kappa (42), alpha (-115.7), phi (-139.5), psi (128.1), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.25), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0.25), KB05 (57.92876317), KB03 (59.72256527), KB02 (40.7015185).\n\nDescription:  Residue A5YKK6 1541 has a moderate depth (1.96) and solvent accessibility (absolute_sasa 20.5), a coordination number of 33, and weak hydrogen bonds (h_nho1 -0.2, h_ohn1 -0.2). It has an undefined secondary structure (struct_motif N/A), is not at an interface (interface FALSE), and contains aliphatic and acidic components (aliphatic 0.5, acidic 0.25).\n\nSummary: This residue shows characteristics of a loop or disordered region due to the lack of defined secondary structure. Its moderate solvent accessibility suggests a potential role in interactions with the solvent or other molecules.\n\n\n**Row 4: site: A5YKK6 2345**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A5YKK6 2345), depth (1.959861529), absolute_sasa (51.66105331), hse_up (13), hse_down (9), coord_number (22), rsa (0.508982036), h_nho1 (-0.9), h_ohn1 (-0.1), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (0.975), kappa (84.2), alpha (18.3), phi (-81.1), psi (-63.5), struct_motif (S), pocket (0), interface (TRUE), basic (0.333333333), acidic (0.333333333), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.333333333), aromatic (0), KB05 (59.47629866), KB03 (67.4885684), KB02 (38.12947098).\n\nDescription: At site A5YKK6 2345, a relatively surface-exposed residue (absolute_sasa 51.66, depth 1.96) with a moderate coordination number (22) shows weak hydrogen bonds and forms a strand structure (struct_motif S) at an interface (interface TRUE). It contains a mixture of basic and acidic amino acids (basic 0.33, acidic 0.33), and a small proportion of aliphatic residues (aliphatic 0.33).\n\nSummary:  This residue is located at a protein interface, suggesting involvement in protein-protein interactions. The presence of both basic and acidic residues likely contributes to electrostatic interactions.\n\n\n**Row 5: site: A5YKK6 890**\n\nColumn names and values: site (A5YKK6 890), depth (2.410663965), absolute_sasa (0), hse_up (24), hse_down (18), coord_number (42), rsa (0.011976048), h_nho1 (-2.4), h_ohn1 (-2.3), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.93), kappa (112.7), alpha (47.2), phi (-62.5), psi (-44), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (TRUE), basic (0.166666667), acidic (0), polar (0.333333333), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0), KB05 (52.42085035), KB03 (61.01369443), KB02 (53.64392014).\n\nDescription: Site A5YKK6 890 features a buried residue (absolute_sasa 0, depth 2.41) with a high coordination number (42) exhibiting strong hydrogen bonds (h_nho1 -2.4, h_ohn1 -2.3) and forming a helical structure (struct_motif H) at a protein interface (interface TRUE).  It is composed mainly of aliphatic and polar residues (aliphatic 0.5, polar 0.33).\n\nSummary: This deeply buried residue, despite its location at an interface, is crucial for the protein core stability due to its extensive hydrogen bonding and high coordination number.  Its predominantly aliphatic and polar composition is consistent with its role in the protein's interior.\n"
