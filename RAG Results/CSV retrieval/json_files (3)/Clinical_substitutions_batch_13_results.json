        "response": "The provided text is not a CSV file; it's a collection of entries, each containing a protein ID (NP_000007.1), a wild-type protein sequence (a long string of amino acids), a mutant sequence (differing from the wild-type at a specific position), and an annotation (\"Pathogenic\").  For each entry,  the protein ID remains constant, indicating that the mutations are all within the same protein. The wild-type sequence is identical across all entries, while each mutant exhibits a single amino acid change at a different position, all of which are annotated as pathogenic.  This suggests that these specific amino acid changes at positions 281, 317, 287, 294, and 317 (with Q317 having two different mutations) within the protein NP_000007.1 are all associated with a pathogenic effect.\n"
