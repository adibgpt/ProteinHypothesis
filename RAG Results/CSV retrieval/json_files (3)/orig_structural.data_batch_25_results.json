        "response": "Here's an analysis of each row, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00629 122):**  Site O00629, residue 122, exhibits a depth of 3.09, a low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 1.29, and a high coordination number of 38, suggesting a buried residue with extensive interactions.  HSE scores indicate 27 upward and 11 downward hydrogen bonds.  The residue's structural motif is H, it's not located in a pocket or interface, and its composition is primarily aliphatic (57%).  Calculated KB values (KB05: 43.85, KB03: 54.99, KB02: 18.20) suggest a specific interaction profile.  The low ASA, high coordination number, and high KB values indicate a highly constrained and potentially functionally important residue.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00625 106):** Site O00625, residue 106, displays a depth of 2.01 and a significantly higher absolute ASA of 46.27, indicating a more exposed location.  It has a lower coordination number of 30 and a moderate RSA of 0.28.  The HSE scores (14 up, 16 down) suggest a balanced hydrogen bonding environment.  The residue is characterized as 40% polar and 40% aliphatic, with no defined structural motif.  Its KB values (KB05: 8.32, KB03: 4.23, KB02: 1.99) are considerably lower than in Row 1, implying weaker interactions. Its surface exposure and lower KB values suggest a less crucial role in the protein structure or function.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00625 79):** Site O00625, residue 79, has a shallow depth of 1.86 and a very high absolute ASA of 84.92, indicating high surface exposure.  It has a low coordination number of 22 and a high RSA of 0.45.  The HSE scores (8 up, 14 down) suggest a predominantly downward hydrogen bonding pattern.  Its structural motif is T, and it's composed of 25% basic, 25% acidic, and 25% structural residues, with 25% aromatic, indicating diverse chemical properties. The low KB values (KB05: 0.20, KB03: 9.53, KB02: 5.77) and high ASA suggest a surface-exposed residue with potentially limited specific interactions.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00541 391):** Site O00541, residue 391, has a depth of 1.97 and a moderate absolute ASA of 51.78.  It has a coordination number of 29 and an RSA of 0.32.  The HSE scores (9 up, 20 down) suggest a predominantly downward hydrogen bonding pattern.  Its structural motif is E, and it's composed of 50% basic and 50% aromatic residues.  The KB values (KB05: 16.51, KB03: 18.67, KB02: 10.88) suggest moderate interaction strength.  The combination of moderate ASA, coordination number, and KB values suggests a residue with intermediate importance in the protein structure or function.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00629 228):** Site O00629, residue 228, has a depth of 2.99 and a low absolute ASA of 5.36.  It has a high coordination number of 47 and a low RSA of 0.02, indicating a buried location.  HSE scores (25 up, 22 down) suggest a relatively balanced hydrogen bonding environment.  The residue's structural motif is H, it's located at an interface, and its composition is primarily aliphatic (67%) with some aromatic (17%) components.  The high KB values (KB05: 45.50, KB03: 52.79, KB02: 30.14) suggest strong interactions.  Its buried location, high coordination number, interface location, and high KB values suggest a crucial role in protein-protein interactions.\n"
