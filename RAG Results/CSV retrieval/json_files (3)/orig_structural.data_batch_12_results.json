        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a CSV file.  Therefore, the \"CSV file\" interpretation is implied.\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00291 430):**\n\nSite O00291 at position 430 exhibits a depth of 2.91, a relatively low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (2.49), and a coordination number of 27, suggesting a buried residue.  Its HSE (hydrogen-sidechain environment) scores (up: 15, down: 12) indicate a moderate degree of hydrogen bonding. The relatively high RSA (0.39) and the structural motif 'H' suggest it is a helix.  The low values for KB05, KB03, and KB02 suggest low hydrophobicity and it has a slightly basic character.  It's not at an interface and isn't located in a pocket.\n\n**Summary:** This residue is likely buried within the protein structure, participating in moderate hydrogen bonding and exhibiting characteristics of a helix.\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00273 47):**\n\nSite O00273 at position 47 has a depth of 1.64 and a high absolute solvent-accessible surface area (43.51), indicating surface exposure.  Its coordination number is 30, and HSE scores (up: 14, down: 16) show balanced hydrogen bonding.  The low RSA (0.28) is somewhat inconsistent with the high ASA.  The 'H' structural motif indicates a helix.  It lacks significant hydrophobicity, and is slightly polar. It is not located at an interface or within a pocket.\n\n**Summary:** This surface residue is a helix with a relatively high number of interactions, despite showing a low RSA value in comparison to its ASA.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00267 740):**\n\nSite O00267 at position 740 has a depth of 1.77 and a high absolute solvent-accessible surface area (62.06), indicating surface exposure. The coordination number is 32, and the HSE scores (up: 17, down: 15) suggest a slightly more upward-oriented hydrogen bonding environment.  The high RSA (0.78) confirms surface exposure.  Its structural motif is 'S' (likely a strand), and it's located in a pocket (144.38) and at an interface. It is polar.\n\n**Summary:** This surface residue is part of a strand, located within a pocket and at a protein interface, indicating a likely role in protein-protein interactions.\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00273 289):**\n\nSite O00273 at position 289 shows a depth of 3.30 and a very low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (0), indicating a buried residue. The coordination number is 29, and the HSE scores (up: 18, down: 11) suggest a largely upward-oriented hydrogen bonding environment.  Its RSA (0) and the structural motif 'H' (helix) further supports its buried nature.  It shows low hydrophobicity and is slightly acidic and structural.  It's not at an interface and is not in a pocket.\n\n**Summary:** This deeply buried residue is a helix with limited interactions, likely playing a structural role within the protein core.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00273 38):**\n\nSite O00273 at position 38 has a depth of 2.22 and a high absolute solvent-accessible surface area (55.36), indicating surface exposure.  Its coordination number is 28, and the HSE scores (up: 4, down: 24) show a predominantly downward-oriented hydrogen bonding environment.  The RSA (0.31) supports surface exposure.  The structural motif is 'S' (strand), and it's at an interface. It is slightly acidic and aliphatic.\n\n**Summary:** This surface residue is a strand located at a protein interface, suggesting it may participate in protein-protein interactions.  Its unusual HSE scores suggest a specific interaction pattern.\n"
