        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00429 431):**  Site O00429 residue 431 has a depth of 2.78, a relatively low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 1.21, and a coordination number of 43, suggesting a buried, highly interacting residue.  Its HSE scores (33 up, 10 down) indicate more upward hydrogen bonds.  The low RSA (0.006) further supports its buried nature.  The residue is characterized by H structural motif,  lacks pocket interaction, and shows a predominantly aliphatic composition (0.4) with some aromatic character (0.2).  KB values suggest moderate interaction energies.  In summary, this residue is deeply buried, highly coordinated, and likely plays a crucial structural role.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00429 446):** Site O00429 residue 446, with a depth of 2.31 and a significantly higher ASA of 12.57, is less buried than residue 431.  It has a coordination number of 30 and a higher RSA (0.042), suggesting more exposure to solvent. HSE scores (20 up, 10 down) show a preference for upward hydrogen bonds.  The residue is part of a G structural motif and is located within a pocket (133).  It exhibits a more balanced distribution of amino acid types, with a relatively even mix of basic, acidic, aliphatic, and aromatic residues. KB values suggest weaker interactions compared to residue 431. In summary, this residue is moderately exposed, less coordinated, and located within a pocket, suggesting potential functional significance.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00429 367):**  Site O00429 residue 367 shows a depth of 2.07 and a high ASA of 50.44, indicating a surface-exposed location.  It has a coordination number of 32 and a high RSA (0.425),  further confirming its surface location.  HSE scores (11 up, 21 down) reveal a preference for downward hydrogen bonds.  The residue belongs to an H structural motif, lacks pocket interaction, and is primarily aliphatic (0.75) with a smaller aromatic component (0.25).  KB values are moderate. In summary, this residue is highly exposed to the solvent, and it\u2019s largely aliphatic composition suggests a role in surface interactions or structural stability.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00429 361):** Site O00429 residue 361 possesses a depth of 1.87 and a high ASA of 55.76, indicating a surface location. The coordination number is 25, and RSA is 0.31, consistent with surface exposure. HSE scores (13 up, 12 down) show a relatively balanced distribution of hydrogen bonds.  This residue is in an S structural motif, lacks pocket interaction, and consists of structural and aliphatic components. Its KB values suggest moderate interaction energies. In summary, this residue is surface-exposed, and its balanced amino acid composition might indicate a role in mediating interactions or maintaining structural integrity.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00429 470):** Site O00429 residue 470 exhibits a depth of 1.83 and a very high ASA of 83.51, confirming its surface location.  It has a low coordination number of 21 and a high RSA of 0.473, further highlighting its surface exposure.  HSE scores (7 up, 14 down) indicate a predominance of downward hydrogen bonds.  The residue belongs to an H structural motif, lacks pocket interaction, and is predominantly aliphatic (0.67).  KB values suggest relatively weak interactions.  In summary, this is a highly exposed residue with a primarily aliphatic character, suggesting a role in surface interactions or maintaining structural stability.\n"
