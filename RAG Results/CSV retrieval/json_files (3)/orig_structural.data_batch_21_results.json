        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1:** site: O00429 345; depth: 2.57; absolute_sasa: 26.39; hse_up: 10; hse_down: 18; coord_number: 28; rsa: 0.14; h_nho1: -2.2; h_ohn1: -1.7; h_nho2: -0.2; h_ohn2: -0.1; tco: 0.88; kappa: 112.6; alpha: 57.2; phi: -46.8; psi: -43.3; struct_motif: H; pocket: 0; interface: FALSE; basic: 0.17; acidic: 0.17; polar: 0.33; cysteine: 0; structural: 0; aliphatic: 0.17; aromatic: 0.17; KB05: 56.92; KB03: 59.34; KB02: 27.28.  Site O00429, residue 345, shows a moderate depth (2.57), relatively high solvent-accessible surface area (26.39), and a coordination number of 28, suggesting a location within the protein but not deeply buried.  The relatively high RSA (0.14) further supports this.  Its structural motif is H, and it lacks an interface.  The amino acid composition shows a balance of basic, acidic, polar, aliphatic, and aromatic residues.  The KB values suggest moderate interaction energies.\n\n**Row 2:** site: O00423 276; depth: 2.82; absolute_sasa: 6.04; hse_up: 22; hse_down: 26; coord_number: 48; rsa: 0.03; h_nho1: -0.5; h_ohn1: -2.1; h_nho2: -0.1; h_ohn2: -0.3; tco: -0.98; kappa: 54.6; alpha: -172; phi: -147.9; psi: 160; struct_motif: E; pocket: 492.125; interface: FALSE; basic: 0.14; acidic: 0; polar: 0.14; cysteine: 0; structural: 0.14; aliphatic: 0.57; aromatic: 0; KB05: 46.84; KB03: 52.69; KB02: 34.95. Site O00423, residue 276, is characterized by a relatively shallow depth (2.82) and low solvent-accessible surface area (6.04), indicating a buried location within the protein.  Its high coordination number (48) and low RSA (0.03) further support this. The structural motif is E, and it's located in a pocket (492.125).  It's predominantly aliphatic, lacking acidic and aromatic residues.\n\n\n**Row 3:** site: O00425 44; depth: 4.01; absolute_sasa: 0; hse_up: 22; hse_down: 9; coord_number: 31; rsa: 0; h_nho1: -2.8; h_ohn1: -0.2; h_nho2: -0.4; h_ohn2: -0.1; tco: -0.73; kappa: 31.8; alpha: -107.9; phi: -103.5; psi: 163.6; struct_motif: N/A; pocket: 0; interface: FALSE; basic: 0; acidic: 0.29; polar: 0.29; cysteine: 0; structural: 0.14; aliphatic: 0.29; aromatic: 0; KB05: 14.52; KB03: 31.14; KB02: 11.11. Site O00425, residue 44, is deeply buried (depth 4.01) with no solvent-accessible surface area (0), suggesting a core location.  Its coordination number (31) is moderate, and the structural motif is not defined. It's predominantly acidic and aliphatic, lacking basic and aromatic residues, and has low KB values.\n\n\n**Row 4:** site: O00429 300; depth: 2.32; absolute_sasa: 7.11; hse_up: 14; hse_down: 10; coord_number: 24; rsa: 0.04; h_nho1: -1.5; h_ohn1: -1.6; h_nho2: -0.2; h_ohn2: -0.2; tco: 0.58; kappa: 99.1; alpha: 85.5; phi: -96.4; psi: -15; struct_motif: H; pocket: 0; interface: FALSE; basic: 0.17; acidic: 0.33; polar: 0; cysteine: 0; structural: 0.17; aliphatic: 0.33; aromatic: 0; KB05: 61.40; KB03: 70.79; KB02: 31.91. Site O00429, residue 300, has a shallow depth (2.32) and low solvent-accessible surface area (7.11), indicating a partially buried location.  The coordination number (24) and RSA (0.04) support this.  Its structural motif is H, and it's predominantly acidic and aliphatic.  It has higher KB values compared to the previous rows.\n\n\n**Row 5:** site: O00423 330; depth: 2.43; absolute_sasa: 6.12; hse_up: 24; hse_down: 24; coord_number: 48; rsa: 0.04; h_nho1: -1.2; h_ohn1: -1.6; h_nho2: -0.1; h_ohn2: -0.3; tco: -0.97; kappa: 60.2; alpha: 165.2; phi: -132.7; psi: 149.3; struct_motif: E; pocket: 492.125; interface: FALSE; basic: 0; acidic: 0; polar: 0.14; cysteine: 0; structural: 0; aliphatic: 0.86; aromatic: 0; KB05: 44.66; KB03: 47.68; KB02: 27.22. Site O00423, residue 330, exhibits a moderate depth (2.43) and low solvent-accessible surface area (6.12), suggesting a partially buried location.  Its high coordination number (48) and low RSA (0.04) support this.  The structural motif is E, and it's located in a pocket (492.125). It's highly aliphatic, lacking acidic and basic residues.\n"
