its hydrogen bond parameters (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) indicate some hydrogen bonding interactions, and the structural motif is classified as H, with a lack of interface contact and primarily aliphatic and basic composition.\n\nSummary: This residue is moderately buried, with a mix of polar and nonpolar characteristics, and exhibits typical secondary structure features (H-helix).\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O14920 59):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14920 59), depth (2.080), absolute_sasa (49.559), hse_up (8), hse_down (18), coord_number (26), rsa (0.275), h_nho1 (-1.7), h_ohn1 (-2.1), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.912), kappa (109.7), alpha (57), phi (-64.6), psi (-44.3), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.667), aromatic (0.333), KB05 (23.110), KB03 (24.448), KB02 (15.328).\n\nSentence:  Residue 59 of site O14920 is located at a depth of 2.080 units, exhibiting a relatively low RSA (0.275) and a coordination number of 26, indicating a buried location; it is characterized by a predominantly aliphatic and aromatic composition with strong hydrogen bonding indicated by negative h_nho1 and h_ohn1 values and a helical secondary structure (H).\n\nSummary: This residue is significantly buried, with a composition suggesting potential interaction with hydrophobic regions, and shows features consistent with an alpha-helix.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O14936 418):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14936 418), depth (1.599), absolute_sasa (104.053), hse_up (6), hse_down (9), coord_number (15), rsa (0.683), h_nho1 (-1.6), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.8), kappa (107.6), alpha (75.7), phi (-93.3), psi (-38), struct_motif (T), pocket (0), interface (TRUE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (1),  cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0), aromatic (0), KB05 (11.827), KB03 (12.437), KB02 (3.616).\n\nSentence: Site O14936, residue 418, is located at a shallow depth (1.600 units) with a high RSA (0.683) and a low coordination number (15), indicating a surface-exposed location; it is entirely polar and participates in an interface, characterized by a turn (T) structural motif.\n\nSummary: This residue is highly exposed on the protein surface, involved in interactions, and has polar characteristics.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O14936 132):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14936 132), depth (5.052), absolute_sasa (0), hse_up (24), hse_down (10), coord_number (34), rsa (0), h_nho1 (-2), h_ohn1 (-2.6), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.6), tco (0.941), kappa (113.7), alpha (46.5), phi (-56.4), psi (-50.8), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.2), acidic (0), polar (0.2), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.4), aromatic (0.2), KB05 (41.432), KB03 (41.951), KB02 (26.522).\n\nSentence: Residue 132 of site O14936 is deeply buried (depth 5.052 units) with no accessible surface area (RSA 0) and a high coordination number (34), suggesting a tightly packed core location; it has a helical (H) structure and a composition that is partly basic, polar, aliphatic, and aromatic.\n\nSummary: This residue is deeply buried in the protein core, has extensive interactions, and exhibits a helical structure.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O14929 120):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14929 120), depth (2.319), absolute_sasa (15.699), hse_up (15), hse_down (11), coord_number (26), rsa (0.108), h_nho1 (-2.6), h_ohn1 (-2.3), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (-0.575), kappa (15.9), alpha (-150.7), phi (-85.7), psi (161.6), struct_motif (B), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.167), polar (0.5), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.167), aromatic (0.167), KB05 (31.806), KB03 (38.012), KB02 (27.671).\n\nSentence: Residue 120 of site O14929 is moderately buried (depth 2.319 units) with low RSA (0.108) and a coordination number of 26;
