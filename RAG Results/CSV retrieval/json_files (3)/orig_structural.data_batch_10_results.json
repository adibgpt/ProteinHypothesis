        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a true CSV file, so a \"column name\" is simply the key.  Also, the meaning of many of the values (e.g., KB05, KB03, KB02) is unknown without further context, limiting the depth of interpretation.\n\n\n**Row 1:**\n\nColumn Names and Values: site: O00244 41, depth: 1.859145825, absolute_sasa: 42.90239353, hse_up: 5, hse_down: 28, coord_number: 33, rsa: 0.239520958, h_nho1: -2.7, h_ohn1: -2.2, h_nho2: -0.4, h_ohn2: -0.4, tco: -0.949, kappa: 11.5, alpha: -171.6, phi: -112.5, psi: 132.2, struct_motif: E, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0.5, polar: 0, cysteine: 0, structural: 0, aliphatic: 0.5, aromatic: 0, KB05: -0.389831814, KB03: 0.303200379, KB02: -1.349112837\n\nDescription: Site O00244, residue 41, exhibits a depth of 1.86, a relatively high absolute solvent-accessible surface area (42.90), and a moderate coordination number (33), suggesting exposure to solvent;  it has a low relative solvent accessibility (RSA 0.24) with predominantly acidic character (0.5) and aliphatic components (0.5),  and shows specific hydrogen bond parameters (h_nho1, h_ohn1, etc.) and dihedral angles (alpha, phi, psi) consistent with a type E structural motif.  The values of KB05, KB03, and KB02 are negative or near zero.\n\n\nSummary: This residue is partially buried, with a mix of acidic and aliphatic characteristics.\n\n\n**Row 2:**\n\nColumn Names and Values: site: O00212 28, depth: 2.434970256, absolute_sasa: 0, hse_up: 20, hse_down: 11, coord_number: 31, rsa: 0.011976048, h_nho1: -1.5, h_ohn1: -0.2, h_nho2: -0.1, h_ohn2: -0.1, tco: 0.565, kappa: 93.6, alpha: -96.6, phi: -85.8, psi: -5.4, struct_motif: S, struct_motif: S, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0.142857143, acidic: 0.285714286, polar: 0, cysteine: 0.142857143, structural: 0.428571429, aliphatic: 0, aromatic: 0, KB05: 55.57928674, KB03: 62.52537369, KB02: 38.63490383\n\nDescription: Site O00212, residue 28, is deeply buried (depth 2.43, absolute_sasa 0), with a coordination number of 31 and extremely low RSA (0.01); it shows a mix of basic, acidic, and cysteine components, with a significant structural component.  Its dihedral angles (alpha, phi, psi) and hydrogen bond parameters define a type S structural motif.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 have significantly higher positive values than in Row 1.\n\nSummary: This is a highly buried residue with a unique amino acid composition and a distinct structural motif, indicated by high KB values.\n\n\n**Row 3:**\n\nColumn Names and Values: site: O00212 171, depth: 2.634340553, absolute_sasa: 0, hse_up: 23, hse_down: 13, coord_number: 36, rsa: 0.005988024, h_nho1: -2, h_ohn1: -1.8, h_nho2: -0.3, h_ohn2: -0.4, tco: -0.969, kappa: 31.5, alpha: -134.9, phi: -159.1, psi: 164.5, struct_motif: N/A, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0.25, polar: 0.375, cysteine: 0.125, structural: 0.125, aliphatic: 0.125, aromatic: 0, KB05: 51.39824889, KB03: 56.28557957, KB02: 27.12817267\n\nDescription:  Site O00212, residue 171, is completely buried (depth 2.63, absolute_sasa 0),  with a coordination number of 36 and extremely low RSA (0.006); it contains a mix of acidic, polar, cysteine, structural, and aliphatic components.  The structural motif is not specified (N/A).  The KB values are positive and relatively high.\n\nSummary: This residue is deeply buried, exhibiting a diverse amino acid composition and an undefined structural motif, similar to Row 2 in terms of KB values.\n\n\n**Row 4:**\n\nColumn Names and Values: site: O00220 145, depth: 1.821959444, absolute_sasa: 67.6018463, hse_up: 14, hse_down: 12, coord_number: 26, rsa: 0.371257485, h_nho1: -0.3, h_ohn1: -0.4, h_nho2: -0.2, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: -0.958, kappa: 4, alpha: -156.1, phi: -117.7, psi: 133.2, struct_motif: E, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0.4, acidic: 0, polar: 0.2, cysteine: 0.2, structural: 0, aliphatic: 0.2, aromatic: 0, KB05: 32.13526728, KB03: 31.5595873, KB02: 13.942896\n\nDescription: Site O00220, residue 145, shows a depth of 1.82, a high absolute_sasa (67.60), and a moderate coordination number (26), suggesting significant solvent exposure;  it has high RSA (0.37) and is primarily basic (0.4) with some polar and cysteine components. The dihedral angles and hydrogen bond parameters suggest an E structural motif.  The KB values are positive but lower than in Rows 2 and 3.\n\nSummary: This residue is highly exposed to solvent and has a predominantly basic character, with a type E structural motif.\n\n\n**Row 5:**\n\nColumn Names and Values: site: O00212 129, depth: 2.888752168, absolute_sasa: 4.830512864, hse_up: 21, hse_down: 27, coord_number: 48, rsa: 0.023952096, h_nho1: -3.7, h_ohn1: -2.5, h_nho2: -0.6, h_ohn2: -0.3, tco: -0.563, kappa: 58.5, alpha: 28.1, phi: -103.9, psi: 162.7, struct_motif: E, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0.166666667, acidic: 0.166666667, polar: 0, cysteine: 0.166666667, structural: 0.166666667, aliphatic: 0.166666667, aromatic: 0.166666667, KB05: 69.36099513, KB03: 66.84552186, KB02: 32.57289413\n\nDescription: Site O00212, residue 129, is relatively deeply buried (depth 2.89), has a low absolute_sasa (4.83), and a high coordination number (48), suggesting a buried location with many interactions; it has low RSA (0.024) and shows a relatively uniform distribution of basic, acidic, cysteine, structural, and aliphatic components.  It displays a type E structural motif.  The KB values are the highest among all the rows.\n\nSummary: This residue is deeply buried with extensive interactions and a balanced amino acid composition, showing the highest KB values.\n\n\nWithout knowing the definitions of `hse_up`, `hse_down`, `tco`, `kappa`, and the KB values, a more precise interpretation is not possible.\n"
