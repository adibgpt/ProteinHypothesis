        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00411 398):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00411 398), depth (1.9902), absolute_sasa (61.4918), hse_up (7), hse_down (15), coord_number (22), rsa (0.3593), h_nho1 (-2.3), h_ohn1 (-2.2), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.92), kappa (110.9), alpha (50), phi (-63.1), psi (-42), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.2), acidic (0.2), polar (0.4), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.2), aromatic (0), KB05 (56.7479), KB03 (44.2345), KB02 (44.4291).\n\nDescription:  Site O00411 398, located at a depth of 1.99, exhibits a relatively high solvent-accessible surface area (61.49) with 7 hydrogen bonds upwards and 15 downwards, resulting in a coordination number of 22 and an RSA of 0.36;  its hydrogen bond energies (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) suggest strong interactions, contributing to a positive torsion angle (TCO of 0.92) and a defined secondary structure (kappa 110.9, alpha 50, phi -63.1, psi -42, struct_motif H);  it is classified as a helix (H) and shows a balanced composition of basic and acidic residues (0.2 each) with a moderate polar component (0.4) and a low KB score.\n\nSummary: This site displays characteristics of a well-defined alpha-helix within a protein, with substantial solvent exposure and numerous hydrogen bonds.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00411 726):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00411 726), depth (2.0676), absolute_sasa (37.2379), hse_up (11), hse_down (11), coord_number (22), rsa (0.1976), h_nho1 (-0.1), h_ohn1 (-1.6), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-1.4), tco (-0.955), kappa (22.9), alpha (-151.7), phi (-117.8), psi (128.7), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0.1667), cysteine (0), structural (0.5), aliphatic (0.3333), aromatic (0), KB05 (58.4862), KB03 (57.9900), KB02 (65.5277).\n\nDescription: Site O00411 726, at a depth of 2.07, has a smaller solvent-accessible surface area (37.24) compared to the previous site, with a balanced number of hydrogen bonds (11 up and 11 down), resulting in a coordination number of 22 and a lower RSA (0.20); its hydrogen bond energies suggest weaker interactions, contributing to a negative torsion angle (TCO of -0.955) and an undefined secondary structure (kappa 22.9, alpha -151.7, phi -117.8, psi 128.7, struct_motif N/A); it's characterized by a high structural component (0.5) and is predominantly aliphatic (0.33).\n\nSummary: This site shows characteristics of a less-structured region of the protein, with limited solvent exposure and weaker hydrogen bonding interactions. The high structural component suggests involvement in a specific structural conformation.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00411 809):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00411 809), depth (2.1816), absolute_sasa (22.6473), hse_up (23), hse_down (15), coord_number (38), rsa (0.1078), h_nho1 (-2.9), h_ohn1 (-0.1), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (0.903), kappa (80.2), alpha (82.4), phi (-66.6), psi (-43.7), struct_motif (S), pocket (736.75), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0.25), cysteine (0), structural (0.75), aliphatic (0), aromatic (0), KB05 (25.0053), KB03 (34.7411), KB02 (30.8347).\n\nDescription: Site O00411 809 is located at a depth of 2.18 and has a very low solvent-accessible surface area (22.65), with a high number of hydrogen bonds (23 up, 15 down), leading to a high coordination number of 38 and a low RSA (0.11); its hydrogen bond energies are indicative of strong interactions, particularly h_nho1; it exhibits a defined secondary structure (kappa 80.2, alpha 82.4, phi -66.6, psi -43.7, struct_motif S) classified as a strand (S) and is located near a pocket (736.75); it is predominantly structural (0.75).\n\nSummary: This site is buried within the protein, exhibiting strong hydrogen bonding and a defined secondary structure (beta strand). Its proximity to a pocket suggests a potential functional role.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00411 472):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00411 472), depth (2.0825), absolute_sasa (40.0408), hse_up (16), hse_down (16), coord_number (32), rsa (0.1976), h_nho1 (-2.4), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.832), kappa (94.6), alpha (68.5), phi (-63.6), psi (-34), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0.25), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0.25), KB05 (24.7504), KB03 (37.7053), KB02 (26.9509).\n\nDescription: Site O00411 472, at a depth of 2.08, has a moderate solvent-accessible surface area (40.04), with a relatively high coordination number (32) and  balanced hydrogen bonds (16 up and 16 down), resulting in an RSA of 0.20; its hydrogen bond energies suggest interactions, contributing to a positive torsion angle (TCO 0.832) and a defined helix structure (kappa 94.6, alpha 68.5, phi -63.6, psi -34, struct_motif H); it is composed mainly of aliphatic (0.5) and aromatic (0.25) residues.\n\nSummary: This site is characterized by a helical structure with a moderate level of solvent exposure and a significant aliphatic and aromatic residue composition.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00411 413):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00411 413), depth (1.8269), absolute_sasa (85.4912), hse_up (5), hse_down (19), coord_number (24), rsa (0.4850), h_nho1 (-0.4), h_ohn1 (-0.4), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (-0.88), kappa (19), alpha (-176.8), phi (-99.2), psi (123.4), struct_motif (E), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0.3333), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.6667), aromatic (0), KB05 (45.3543), KB03 (32.1954), KB02 (24.8948).\n\nDescription: Site O00411 413, at a depth of 1.83, shows a high solvent-accessible surface area (85.49), with an unbalanced number of hydrogen bonds (5 up, 19 down) and a coordination number of 24, resulting in a high RSA (0.49); its hydrogen bond energies are indicative of weak interactions, contributing to a negative torsion angle (TCO -0.88) and an extended structure (kappa 19, alpha -176.8, phi -99.2, psi 123.4, struct_motif E); it is predominantly aliphatic (0.67).\n\nSummary: This site is highly exposed to the solvent and has an extended conformation, likely located on the protein surface.  The high RSA and low number of hydrogen bonds are notable features.\n"
