        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not as a true CSV file, so the analysis is based on the assumption that each block represents a row in a hypothetical CSV.\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00410 1057):**  Site O00410 residue 1057 has a depth of 3.80, a relative solvent-accessible surface area (absolute_sasa) of 1.29,  HSE up and down values of 16, a coordination number of 32, and an RSA of 0, indicating it's buried.  Hydrogen bond parameters (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) show some hydrogen bond interactions, with a TCO of 0.71,  kappa of 92.7, alpha of 65, phi of -65, and psi of -22.5 degrees defining its backbone conformation (struct_motif H).  It has a balanced distribution of basic, acidic, polar, and aliphatic amino acid characteristics and is not located in a pocket or at an interface.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest specific interaction energies.  Summary: This residue is a buried, relatively conserved hydrophobic residue with potential hydrogen bonding interactions.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00410 229):** Site O00410 residue 229 shows a depth of 3.61, a lower absolute_sasa of 1.07, and slightly higher HSE values (25 up, 11 down) and a coordination number of 36, indicating a more exposed location than the previous residue, which is supported by a small RSA value of 0.01.  Hydrogen bond parameters suggest interactions, with a TCO of 0.92, kappa of 100.4, alpha of 53.4, phi of -64.8, and psi of -43.4 degrees (struct_motif G).  It has a composition of acidic, polar, and aliphatic amino acids, with some aromatic character, and is not located in a pocket or at an interface.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest specific interaction energies. Summary: This residue is mostly buried but slightly more exposed, and it has a different amino acid composition compared to the first residue.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00410 1078):** Site O00410 residue 1078 is deeply buried (depth 4.31) with a zero absolute_sasa, HSE values of 22 up and 9 down, and a coordination number of 31.  Its RSA is 0, indicative of a completely buried location. Hydrogen bond parameters suggest interactions, with a TCO of 0.81, kappa of 120.2, alpha of 40.8, phi of -62.2, and psi of -35.9 degrees (struct_motif H). The amino acid composition includes acidic, polar, structural, aliphatic, and aromatic types, and it's not in a pocket or interface. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest specific interaction energies. Summary: This deeply buried residue displays a unique amino acid composition compared to the others.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00408 504):** Site O00408 residue 504 has a depth of 4.85, a zero absolute_sasa, and HSE values of 19 up and 25 down, with a coordination number of 44, suggesting a buried location.  The RSA is 0.  Hydrogen bond parameters (TCO = -0.97, kappa = 0.2, alpha = 177.2, phi = -123.5, psi = 136.9) suggest a different conformational state (struct_motif E). The amino acid composition is primarily aliphatic with some acidic and aromatic components, and it's not located in a pocket or interface. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest specific interaction energies. Summary: This residue is deeply buried and has a unique conformation and amino acid composition compared to the others.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00410 110):** Site O00410 residue 110 has a depth of 3.77, an absolute_sasa of 1.29, HSE values of 23 up and 18 down, and a coordination number of 41. The RSA is 0.  Hydrogen bond parameters (TCO = 0.79, kappa = 102.3, alpha = 56.4, phi = -75.8, psi = -32) suggest specific interactions (struct_motif H). It's primarily aliphatic with basic and acidic components, and it's not located in a pocket or interface. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest specific interaction energies. Summary: This residue is relatively buried with a mixture of aliphatic and charged amino acids.\n\n\nThis analysis highlights the differences in depth, solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding, and amino acid composition between the different residues.  The KB values likely represent some kind of binding energy or interaction potential, but without further context, their precise meaning cannot be determined.\n"
