        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data appears to be related to protein structure analysis, but without knowing the exact meaning of each column, the interpretations are limited to describing the relationships between the provided values.\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00151 263):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00151 263), depth (1.7636), absolute_sasa (84.18), hse_up (11), hse_down (5), coord_number (16), rsa (0.46), h_nho1 (-0.1), h_ohn1 (-0.1), h_nho2 (0), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (0.914), kappa (98.1), alpha (-125.3), phi (-90.2), psi (-56.9), struct_motif (S), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.25), acidic (0), polar (0.25), cysteine (0.25), structural (0.25), aliphatic (0), aromatic (0), KB05 (-0.52), KB03 (3.54), KB02 (8.01).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00151, residue 263, shows a relatively shallow depth (1.76) and high solvent-accessible surface area (84.18), with more hydrogen bonds pointing upwards (11) than downwards (5), resulting in a moderate coordination number (16) and RSA (0.46);  its dihedral angles (alpha, phi, psi) suggest a particular secondary structure (S),  and it has a neutral to slightly basic composition, lacking acidic and aromatic residues, with calculated KB values indicating specific interactions.\n\nSummary: This residue is located on the surface of the protein (high SASA), with a relatively low coordination number, suggesting a less buried and potentially flexible region.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00139 406):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00139 406), depth (2.41), absolute_sasa (53.59), hse_up (1), hse_down (24), coord_number (25), rsa (0.32), h_nho1 (-0.1), h_ohn1 (-1.1), h_nho2 (0), h_ohn2 (-1.1), tco (-0.973), kappa (82.4), alpha (-95.2), phi (-164.5), psi (163.5), struct_motif (S), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.17), acidic (0.33), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.33), aromatic (0.17), KB05 (34.51), KB03 (63.67), KB02 (24.12).\n\nDescriptive sentence:  Site O00139, residue 406, exhibits a deeper position (2.41) with a moderate solvent-accessible surface area (53.59), significantly more hydrogen bonds pointing downwards (24) than upwards (1), leading to a higher coordination number (25) and RSA (0.32); its dihedral angles suggest a secondary structure (S), and it is characterized by a higher proportion of acidic and aliphatic residues, with substantially higher KB values compared to row 1.\n\nSummary: This residue is more buried within the protein (lower SASA) and has a high coordination number, indicating a tightly packed environment, with a predominantly acidic character.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00151 307):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00151 307), depth (2.77), absolute_sasa (5.97), hse_up (14), hse_down (15), coord_number (29), rsa (0.04), h_nho1 (-0.3), h_ohn1 (-2.7), h_ohn2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-1.7), tco (-0.642), kappa (41.8), alpha (-111.2), phi (-85.5), psi (138.5), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.17), acidic (0.17), polar (0.17), cysteine (0.17), structural (0), aliphatic (0.33), aromatic (0), KB05 (15.28), KB03 (14.80), KB02 (11.74).\n\nDescriptive sentence:  Site O00151, residue 307, is deeply buried (2.77) with a very low solvent-accessible surface area (5.97),  a high coordination number (29) and low RSA (0.04), indicating a tightly packed core region; it lacks a defined secondary structure (N/A) and has a relatively balanced amino acid composition with a higher proportion of aliphatic residues;  its KB values are intermediate compared to the previous rows.\n\nSummary: This residue is strongly buried in the protein core, with a high coordination number and is likely involved in strong internal interactions.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00151 260):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00151 260), depth (3.40), absolute_sasa (0), hse_up (15), hse_down (10), coord_number (25), rsa (0.01), h_nho1 (-2.5), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (-0.072), kappa (18.8), alpha (-148), phi (-54.5), psi (158.7), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.25), acidic (0.125), polar (0.125), cysteine (0.125), structural (0.125), aliphatic (0.25), aromatic (0), KB05 (13.11), KB03 (11.36), KB02 (12.96).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00151, residue 260, is extremely buried (3.40) with no solvent-accessible surface area (0), a high coordination number (25) and very low RSA (0.01), indicating a highly packed environment; it lacks a defined secondary structure (N/A) and has a relatively balanced amino acid composition, with KB values suggesting specific interactions.\n\nSummary: This residue is completely buried within the protein core and is likely crucial for maintaining the protein's tertiary structure.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00139 420):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00139 420), depth (1.85), absolute_sasa (29.46), hse_up (17), hse_down (6), coord_number (23), rsa (0.18), h_nho1 (-1.7), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.975), kappa (110.4), alpha (48.3), phi (-67.6), psi (-50.3), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.2), acidic (0), polar (0.4), cysteine (0), structural (0.2), aliphatic (0.2), aromatic (0), KB05 (35.48), KB03 (39.29), KB02 (25.59).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00139, residue 420, is relatively shallow (1.85) with a low to moderate solvent-accessible surface area (29.46),  more hydrogen bonds pointing upwards (17) than downwards (6), resulting in a moderate coordination number (23) and RSA (0.18); its dihedral angles suggest an alpha-helix secondary structure (H), it is characterized by a high proportion of polar residues, and has high KB values.\n\nSummary: This residue is located on the surface or near the surface of the protein, in an alpha-helix, and is likely involved in interactions with other molecules or regions of the protein due to its polar nature.\n"
