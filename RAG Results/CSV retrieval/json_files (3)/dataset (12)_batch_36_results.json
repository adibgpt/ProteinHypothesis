Therefore, I cannot analyze it as a CSV.  However, I can describe each line individually as requested:\n\n\n**Line 1:** The protein sequence MSIQHFRVALIPFFAAFCLPVFAHPETLVKVKDAEDQLGARVGYIELDLNSGKILESFRPEERFPMMSTFKVLLCGAVLSRVDAGQEQLGRRIHYSQNDLVEYSPVTEKHLTDGMTVRELCSAAITMSDNTAANLLLTTIGGPKELTAFLHNMGDHVTRLDRWEPELNEAIPNDERDTTMPAAMATTLRKLLTGELLTLASRQQLIDWMEADKVAGPLLRSALPAGWFIADKSGAGERGSRGIIAALGPDGKPSRIVVIYTTGSQATMDERNRQIAEIGFSLIKHW has a predicted label of 0.949749887 during the test stage. This suggests a high probability of a positive outcome or classification based on the model's prediction.\n\n**Line 2:**  The protein sequence MSIQHFRVALIPFFAAFCLPVFAHPETLVKVKDAEDQLGARVGYIELDLNSGKILESFRPEERFPMMSTFKTLLCGAVLSRVDAGQEQLGRRIHYSQNDLVEYSPVTEKHLTDGMTVRELCSAAITMSDNTAANLLLTTIGGPKELTAFLHNMGDHVTRLDRWEPELNEAIPNDERDTTMPAAMATTLRKLLTGELLTLASRQQLIDWMEADKVAGPLLRSALPAGWFIADKSGAGERGSRGIIAALGPDGKPSRIVVIYTTGSQATMDERNRQIAEIGASLIKHW, slightly different from the first, received a test stage label of 0.920430124, indicating a slightly lower, but still high, predicted probability.  The difference in sequences may account for the difference in prediction scores.\n\n**Line 3:** The protein sequence MSIQHFRVALIPFFAAFCLPVFAFPETLVKVKDAEDQLGARVGYIELDLNSGKILESFRPEERFPMMSTFKVLLCGAVLSRVDAGQEQLGRRIHYSQNDLVEYSPVTEKHLTDGMTVRELCSAAITMSDNTAANLLLTTIGGPKELTAFLHNMGDHVTRLDRWEPELNEAIPNDERDTTMPAAMATTLRKLLTGELLTLASRQQLIDWMEADKVAGPLLRSALPAGWFIADKSGAGERGSRGIIAALGPDGKPSRIVVIYTTGSQATMDERNRQIAEIGASLIKHW has a label of 0.958437264 in the test stage, representing the highest prediction probability among the provided examples.  The minor sequence change compared to line 1 resulted in an increased prediction.\n\n**Line 4:**  The protein sequence MSIQHFRVALIPFFAAFCLPVFAHPETLVKVKDAEDQLGARVGYIELDLNSGKILESFRPEERFPMMSTFKVLLCGAVLSRVDAGQEQLGRRIHYSQNDLVEYSPVTEKHLTDGMTVRELCSAAITMSDNTAANLLLTTIGGPKELTAFLHNMGDHVTRLDRWEPELNEAIPNDERDTTMPAAMATTLRKLLTGELLTLASRQQLIDWMEADKVAGPLLRSALPAGWFIADKSGAGERGSRGIIAALGQDGKPSRIVVIYTTGSQATMDERNRQIAEIGASLIKHW received a test stage label of 0.934147. This is comparable to previous examples, suggesting a consistent prediction performance.  A small sequence difference compared to line 1 is observed.\n\n**Line 5:** The protein sequence MSIQHFRVALIPFFAAFCLPVFAHPETLVKVKDAEDQLGARVGYIELDLNSGKILESFRPEERFPMMSTFKVLLCGAVLSRVDAGQEQLGRRIHYSQNDLVEYSPVTEKHLTDGMTVRELCSAAITMSDNTAANLLLTTIGGPKELTAFLHNMGDHVTRLDRWEPELNEAIPNDERDTTMPAAMATTLRKLLTGELLTLASRQQLIDWMEADKVAGPLLRSALQAGWFIADKSGAGERGSRGIIAALGPDGKPSRIVVIYTTGSQATMDERNRQIAEIGASLIKHW, shows a lower prediction label of 0.80665952 during the test stage.  The observed sequence variation compared to other entries might explain the reduced prediction score.\n\n\nIn summary, the data shows that small variations in the protein sequence can lead to different prediction scores.  The model seems to perform consistently in the test stage, with most predictions exceeding 0.9, except for the last example.  Further analysis would be needed to understand the correlation between specific sequence changes and the resulting prediction scores.\n"
