        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: A0AVT1 231):**  Site A0AVT1 231 has a depth of 2.898, an absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 0, 19 HSE (hydrogen-bond score) values above and 13 below, a coordination number of 32, a relative solvent-accessible surface area (RSA) of 0.006,  H-bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) of -2.4, -0.2, -0.3, and 0 respectively, a torsion angle (tco) of -0.674, kappa of 36.1, alpha of -73.2, phi of -117.3, psi of 166.2, a structural motif (struct_motif) of E, no pocket involvement (pocket: 0), no interface participation (interface: FALSE), and amino acid composition of 0.2 basic, 0 acidic, 0.4 polar, 0 cysteine, 0 structural, 0.2 aliphatic, and 0.2 aromatic residues; KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 19.99, 25.64, and 15.08 respectively.  This site is buried (ASA=0), has a relatively low coordination number, and displays characteristics of an extended conformation (struct_motif E, phi and psi angles).\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: A0AVT1 581):** Site A0AVT1 581 exhibits a depth of 5.508, a slightly exposed ASA of 0.849, 25 HSE values above and 16 below, a coordination number of 41, an RSA of 0, H-bond scores of -2.5, -1.8, -0.2, and -0.6, a tco of 0.905, kappa of 110.2, alpha of 51.8, phi of -66.1, psi of -40.2, a helical structural motif (struct_motif H), no pocket involvement (pocket: 0), no interface participation (interface: FALSE), and an amino acid composition of approximately 17% basic, 17% acidic, 33% polar, 0 cysteine, 0 structural, 33% aliphatic, and 0 aromatic residues; KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 14.64, 28.38, and 20.26 respectively. This site is mostly buried, located in a helical region, and has a higher coordination number suggesting a more central location within the protein.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: A0AVT1 174):** Site A0AVT1 174 is characterized by a depth of 5.152, an ASA of 0, 23 HSE values above and 12 below, a coordination number of 35, an RSA of 0, H-bond scores of -2.8, -1.9, -0.2, and -0.6, a tco of 0.906, kappa of 114.6, alpha of 44.4, phi of -68.4, psi of -43.6, a helical structural motif (struct_motif H), no pocket involvement (pocket: 0), no interface participation (interface: FALSE), and an amino acid composition of 0 basic, 0 acidic, 50% polar, 0 cysteine, 0 structural, 25% aliphatic, and 25% aromatic residues; KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 54.07, 60.34, and 39.94 respectively. Similar to site 581, this buried site is also in a helical region. The notably higher KB values suggest a different local environment.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: A0AVT1 546):** Site A0AVT1 546 displays a depth of 2.153, a significantly exposed ASA of 18.25, 7 HSE values above and 19 below, a coordination number of 26, an RSA of 0.126, H-bond scores of -1.6, -1.7, -0.1, and -0.1, a tco of -0.845, kappa of 81.8, alpha of -86.4, phi of -136.1, psi of 172.4, a strand structural motif (struct_motif S), a pocket involvement of 533.38 (pocket: 533.375), no interface participation (interface: FALSE), and an amino acid composition of approximately 17% basic, 0 acidic, 33% polar, 0 cysteine, 17% structural, 17% aliphatic, and 17% aromatic residues; KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 57.93, 29.47, and 20.06 respectively. This site is highly exposed and located within a pocket, suggesting a potential binding site.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: A0AVT1 156):** Site A0AVT1 156 shows a depth of 4.750, an ASA of 0, 25 HSE values above and 21 below, a coordination number of 46, an RSA of 0, H-bond scores of -1.1, -2.5, -0.2, and -0.4, a tco of -0.969, kappa of 62.8, alpha of -159.9, phi of -134.6, psi of 144.7, an extended structural motif (struct_motif E), no pocket involvement (pocket: 0), no interface participation (interface: FALSE), and an amino acid composition of 20% basic, 0 acidic, 20% polar, 0 cysteine, 0 structural, 60% aliphatic, and 0 aromatic residues; KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 34.90, 45.06, and 27.76 respectively.  This buried site, despite a high coordination number, exhibits features of an extended conformation (struct_motif E, phi and psi angles).\n\n\n"
