        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00764 273):**  Site O00764 at position 273 has a depth of 1.98, a relative solvent accessible surface area (RSA) of 0.18, and an absolute SASA of 35.28.  The HSE scores are 15 up and 10 down, indicating a potential interaction, while its coordination number is 25.  The torsion angles (phi, psi) suggest a particular secondary structure (struct_motif H),  with a kappa angle of 111.3 and alpha angle of 51.7.  The absence of interface interaction and a TCO value of 0.92 suggests a buried location. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 5.37, 10.79, and 37.10 respectively.  This site is characterized by its relatively low RSA and moderate depth.\n\n**Row 2 (site: O14531 248):** Site O14531 at position 248 shows a significantly deeper location (depth 2.71) with a very low RSA (0.02) and absolute SASA (3.21). It has high HSE scores (25 up, 17 down), and a high coordination number (42), suggesting a highly interacting residue.  Its TCO is -0.955, phi and psi angles (-114.8 and 129 respectively) do not suggest a defined secondary structure (struct_motif N/A).  The residue exhibits a small proportion of basic, polar, and structural characteristics. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 36.72, 57.90, and 33.15 respectively.  This site is deeply buried and highly coordinated.\n\n**Row 3 (site: O14497 1827):** Site O14497 at position 1827 has a shallow depth (1.88), a high RSA (0.42) and absolute SASA (66.13), and is located at an interface.  It has a low coordination number (17), indicating fewer interactions and HSE scores of 7 up and 10 down.  The residue exhibits a balanced composition of basic, acidic, polar, and aliphatic characteristics.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 41.61, 33.95, and 26.22 respectively. This site is exposed and participates in an interface interaction.\n\n**Row 4 (site: O14497 1968):** Site O14497 at position 1968 displays a moderate depth (2.10), high RSA (0.61) and absolute SASA (37.01), and is located at an interface (pocket value of 561.375).  It has a higher coordination number (33) and HSE scores of 23 up and 10 down. The residue is primarily aliphatic and polar.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 37.98, 51.67, and 31.71 respectively. This site is partially exposed, located within a pocket, and interacts at an interface.\n\n**Row 5 (site: O14523 115):** Site O14523 at position 115 is characterized by a shallow depth (1.63), a very high RSA (0.91), and a very high absolute SASA (157.52). It has a low coordination number (14) and low HSE scores (4 up, 10 down), suggesting limited interactions. It is entirely aliphatic. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 30.35, 31.79, and 25.27 respectively.  This site is highly exposed on the surface.\n"
