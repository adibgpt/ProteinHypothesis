        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented in a text format resembling a CSV, but lacks formal headers.  I will assume the order of values consistently represents the column names.  I will label the columns based on the first row's apparent meaning.\n\n\n**Row 1:** site: A0FGR8 810, depth: 3.212711429, absolute_sasa: 1.071459024, hse_up: 25, hse_down: 13, coord_number: 38, rsa: 0.023952096, h_nho1: -1.8, h_ohn1: -0.3, h_nho2: -0.3, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: -0.861, kappa: 24.7, alpha: -175.1, phi: -120.4, psi: 155.1, struct_motif: E, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0, polar: 0, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.25, aliphatic: 0.75, aromatic: 0, KB05: 50.55811113, KB03: 63.56679416, KB02: 46.47025602\n\nSite A0FGR8 at position 810 exhibits a depth of 3.21, a low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (1.07), 25 HSE up and 13 HSE down, and a coordination number of 38, suggesting a relatively buried residue with numerous interactions.  Its RSA (0.02) further supports this, and the various hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, etc.) indicate moderate hydrogen bonding. The low TCO (-0.861), kappa (24.7), and alpha (-175.1), phi (-120.4), and psi (155.1) angles suggest a specific secondary structure (struct_motif E).  The absence of pocket, interface, basic, acidic, polar, and cysteine residues, alongside  a predominantly aliphatic composition (0.75), contribute to its overall characteristics. The KB values (KB05, KB03, KB02) represent additional properties, perhaps related to energy or interaction scores.  Summary: This residue is deeply buried, primarily aliphatic, and likely part of a specific secondary structure element.\n\n\n**Row 2:** site: A0AVT1 699, depth: 4.144521044, absolute_sasa: 0, hse_up: 19, hse_down: 16, coord_number: 35, rsa: 0, h_nho1: -1.4, h_ohn1: -2.4, h_nho2: -0.2, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: 0.895, kappa: 110.8, alpha: 49.9, phi: -65.6, psi: -39.9, struct_motif: H, pocket: 330, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0, polar: 0.25, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.125, aliphatic: 0.5, aromatic: 0.125, KB05: 41.43076156, KB03: 41.96985004, KB02: 29.38719454\n\nSite A0AVT1 at position 699 is deeply buried (depth 4.14, absolute_sasa 0, rsa 0), has 19 HSE up and 16 HSE down, and a coordination number of 35.  The hydrogen bond scores indicate moderate to strong interactions, and the TCO (0.895), kappa (110.8), alpha (49.9), phi (-65.6), and psi (-39.9) angles suggest a different secondary structure (struct_motif H) compared to row 1.  It's located within a pocket (330) and has a mixed composition including polar, aliphatic, and aromatic residues.  Summary: This deeply buried residue is part of a different secondary structure and resides within a pocket, suggesting a potentially important functional role.\n\n\n**Row 3:** site: A0AVT1 924, depth: 2.043005384, absolute_sasa: 3.486715456, hse_up: 22, hse_down: 13, coord_number: 35, rsa: 0.047904192, h_nho1: -1.8, h_ohn1: -2.3, h_nho2: -0.3, h_ohn2: -0.4, tco: -0.955, kappa: 23.1, alpha: -175.1, phi: -130.1, psi: 142.5, struct_motif: E, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0, polar: 0.666666667, cysteine: 0, structural: 0, aliphatic: 0, aromatic: 0.333333333, KB05: 19.34789303, KB03: 26.48548989, KB02: 19.81249256\n\nSite A0AVT1 at position 924 shows a depth of 2.04, a higher absolute solvent-accessible surface area (3.49), 22 HSE up and 13 HSE down, and a coordination number of 35. The hydrogen bond scores suggest moderate interactions, and its TCO (-0.955), kappa (23.1), alpha (-175.1), phi (-130.1), and psi (142.5) angles indicate a secondary structure (struct_motif E) similar to row 1. It's characterized by a high proportion of polar and aromatic residues. Summary: This residue is less buried than the previous two and has a significant polar and aromatic character, potentially involved in interactions with solvent or other molecules.\n\n\n**Row 4:** site: A0FGR8 210, depth: 2.659242574, absolute_sasa: 14.75121007, hse_up: 13, hse_down: 16, coord_number: 29, rsa: 0.077844311, h_nho1: -2.7, h_ohn1: -2.1, h_nho2: -0.2, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: 0.87, kappa: 104.4, alpha: 54.3, phi: -61.5, psi: -36.6, struct_motif: H, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0.166666667, polar: 0.166666667, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.166666667, aliphatic: 0.333333333, aromatic: 0.166666667, KB05: 52.29160985, KB03: 57.19218523, KB02: 29.3542617\n\nSite A0FGR8 at position 210 has a depth of 2.66, a relatively high absolute solvent-accessible surface area (14.75), 13 HSE up and 16 HSE down, and a coordination number of 29. The hydrogen bond scores suggest strong interactions, and its TCO (0.87), kappa (104.4), alpha (54.3), phi (-61.5), and psi (-36.6) angles indicate a secondary structure (struct_motif H), similar to row 2.  It contains acidic, polar, structural, aliphatic, and aromatic components. Summary: This residue is more exposed to the solvent and displays a mixed composition, potentially involved in both intra- and intermolecular interactions.\n\n\n**Row 5:** site: A0FGR8 611, depth: 2.284931587, absolute_sasa: 51.01695142, hse_up: 6, hse_down: 15, coord_number: 21, rsa: 0.329341317, h_nho1: -1.2, h_ohn1: -2.7, h_nho2: 0, h_ohn2: -0.3, tco: -0.885, kappa: 68.7, alpha: -84.8, phi: -143.2, psi: 172.3, struct_motif: E, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0.25, acidic: 0.25, polar: 0.5, cysteine: 0, structural: 0, aliphatic: 0, aromatic: 0, KB05: 40.48067099, KB03: 38.58417786, KB02: 32.07757669\n\nSite A0FGR8 at position 611 is relatively exposed (depth 2.28, absolute_sasa 51.02, rsa 0.33), with 6 HSE up and 15 HSE down, and a coordination number of 21.  The hydrogen bond scores suggest interactions, and its TCO (-0.885), kappa (68.7), alpha (-84.8), phi (-143.2), and psi (172.3) angles suggest a secondary structure (struct_motif E). It's characterized by the presence of basic, acidic, and polar residues. Summary: This residue is highly exposed on the surface, contains charged residues, and likely plays a role in interactions with the surrounding environment.\n"
