        "response": "The provided text is not a CSV file; it's a collection of data entries, each containing a protein ID (NP_000007.1), a wild-type protein sequence (identical across all entries), a mutant protein sequence, the specific amino acid mutation (e.g., M155T), and an annotation classifying the mutation as \"Pathogenic\".  For example, one entry shows that the mutation M155T in protein NP_000007.1, resulting in a specific change in the protein sequence, is annotated as pathogenic.  Another entry describes the R148K mutation in the same protein, also annotated as pathogenic.  All entries share the same protein ID and wild-type sequence but differ in their mutant sequence and thus the specific amino acid change, all of which are labeled as pathogenic.  This suggests that these specific mutations within this particular protein are all associated with a disease or harmful condition.\n"
