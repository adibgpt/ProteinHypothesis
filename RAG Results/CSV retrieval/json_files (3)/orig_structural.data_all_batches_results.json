Its RSA (0.02) further supports this, and the various hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, etc.) indicate moderate hydrogen bonding. The low TCO (-0.861), kappa (24.7), and alpha (-175.1), phi (-120.4), and psi (155.1) angles suggest a specific secondary structure (struct_motif E).  The absence of pocket, interface, basic, acidic, polar, and cysteine residues, alongside  a predominantly aliphatic composition (0.75), contribute to its overall characteristics. The KB values (KB05, KB03, KB02) represent additional properties, perhaps related to energy or interaction scores.  Summary: This residue is deeply buried, primarily aliphatic, and likely part of a specific secondary structure element.\n\n\n**Row 2:** site: A0AVT1 699, depth: 4.144521044, absolute_sasa: 0, hse_up: 19, hse_down: 16, coord_number: 35, rsa: 0, h_nho1: -1.4, h_ohn1: -2.4, h_nho2: -0.2, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: 0.895, kappa: 110.8, alpha: 49.9, phi: -65.6, psi: -39.9, struct_motif: H, pocket: 330, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0, polar: 0.25, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.125, aliphatic: 0.5, aromatic: 0.125, KB05: 41.43076156, KB03: 41.96985004, KB02: 29.38719454\n\nSite A0AVT1 at position 699 is deeply buried (depth 4.14, absolute_sasa 0, rsa 0), has 19 HSE up and 16 HSE down, and a coordination number of 35.

Its low KB values might suggest a role less directly involved in binding compared to other sites.\n"

Its HSE (hydrogen-sidechain environment) scores (up: 15, down: 12) indicate a moderate degree of hydrogen bonding. The relatively high RSA (0.39) and the structural motif 'H' suggest it is a helix.  The low values for KB05, KB03, and KB02 suggest low hydrophobicity and it has a slightly basic character.  It's not at an interface and isn't located in a pocket.\n\n**Summary:** This residue is likely buried within the protein structure, participating in moderate hydrogen bonding and exhibiting characteristics of a helix.\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00273 47):**\n\nSite O00273 at position 47 has a depth of 1.64 and a high absolute solvent-accessible surface area (43.51), indicating surface exposure.

The coordination number is 32, and the HSE scores (up: 17, down: 15) suggest a slightly more upward-oriented hydrogen bonding environment.  The high RSA (0.78) confirms surface exposure.  Its structural motif is 'S' (likely a strand), and it's located in a pocket (144.38) and at an interface. It is polar.\n\n**Summary:** This surface residue is part of a strand, located within a pocket and at a protein interface, indicating a likely role in protein-protein interactions.\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00273 289):**\n\nSite O00273 at position 289 shows a depth of 3.30 and a very low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (0), indicating a buried residue. The coordination number is 29, and the HSE scores (up: 18, down: 11) suggest a largely upward-oriented hydrogen bonding environment.  Its RSA (0) and the structural motif 'H' (helix) further supports its buried nature.  It shows low hydrophobicity and is slightly acidic and structural.  It's not at an interface and is not in a pocket.\n\n**Summary:** This deeply buried residue is a helix with limited interactions, likely playing a structural role within the protein core.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00273 38):**\n\nSite O00273 at position 38 has a depth of 2.22 and a high absolute solvent-accessible surface area (55.36), indicating surface exposure.  Its coordination number is 28, and the HSE scores (up: 4, down: 24) show a predominantly downward-oriented hydrogen bonding environment.  The RSA (0.31) supports surface exposure.  The structural motif is 'S' (strand), and it's at an interface. It is slightly acidic and aliphatic.\n\n**Summary:** This surface residue is a strand located at a protein interface, suggesting it may participate in protein-protein interactions.  Its unusual HSE scores suggest a specific interaction pattern.\n"

Note that the data appears to represent characteristics of amino acid residues in a protein structure, but without knowing the exact meaning of each column header, interpretations are limited to describing relationships between the provided values.\n\n\n**Site O00429 644:** This residue, identified as O00429 644, has a depth of 2.17, a solvent-accessible surface area (absolute_sasa) of 29.21, and a coordination number of 25, suggesting it's relatively exposed and interacts with many neighboring residues.  Its HSE scores (hse_up: 12, hse_down: 13) indicate a balanced hydrogen bonding environment, while its backbone dihedral angles (phi: -69.7, psi: -18.4) and secondary structure (struct_motif: H) classify it as an alpha-helix.  The residue shows a slight acidic character (acidic: 0.5) and has a relatively high KB05, KB03, and KB02 values (48.76, 58.47, and 43.72 respectively).

The backbone dihedral angles (phi: -74.8, psi: 147.6) and struct_motif (P) classify it as a beta-sheet.  It shows a slightly acidic and polar character, and relatively low KB05, KB03, and KB02 values (10.37, 12.75, and 4.22 respectively). This suggests a less exposed beta-sheet residue with a different chemical environment than the previous one.\n\n\n**Site O00429 505:** Residue O00429 505 displays a depth of 2.27, a small solvent-accessible surface area (absolute_sasa: 11.58), and a coordination number of 23, indicating a relatively buried residue.

Its HSE scores (hse_up: 19, hse_down: 12) indicate an upward-oriented hydrogen bonding pattern.  The lack of a defined secondary structure (struct_motif: N/A) and the backbone dihedral angles (phi: -74.6, psi: 131.1) suggest it's in a disordered region. It's characterized by basic and acidic properties and has relatively low KB05, KB03, and KB02 values (18.67, 42.25, and 11.28 respectively). This suggests a deeply buried, disordered residue with a distinct chemical environment.\n\n**Site O00459 50:** Residue O00459 50 has a depth of 2.29, a large solvent-accessible surface area (absolute_sasa: 61.53), and a coordination number of 26, suggesting a highly exposed and interacting residue.

The lack of a defined secondary structure (struct_motif: N/A) and its backbone dihedral angles (phi: -122.8, psi: 78.8) are suggestive of a loop or disordered region. It's characterized by polar and structural properties and has moderate KB05, KB03, and KB02 values (30.05, 26.99, and 31.46 respectively).

Its low RSA (0.23) indicates limited exposure to solvent, while its hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, etc.) suggest weaker hydrogen bonding interactions. The dihedral angles (phi, psi, alpha) indicate a specific conformation, and the absence of a structural motif suggests a lack of defined secondary structure.  The amino acid composition shows a relatively high proportion of cysteine (0.43) and aliphatic residues (0.29).

Its dihedral angles (-75.1 and -43) indicate an H secondary structure.  This residue is not in a pocket or at an interface, and shows a relatively moderate KB05 value (30.82).  The high aromatic character suggests a potential role in hydrophobic interactions.\n\n\nNote:  The interpretation of KB05, KB03, and KB02 values requires additional context about their meaning within the data source.
