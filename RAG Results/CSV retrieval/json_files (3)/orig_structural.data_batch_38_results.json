it is part of a protein interface, with hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) suggesting weaker interactions, and dihedral angles (kappa, alpha, phi, psi) representing a different conformation than site 798; it has a higher proportion of structural residues (0.4) and a negative torsion angle (-0.776), and elevated KB scores.\n\n\nSummary: This site is surface-exposed, participates in protein interactions, and has a distinct structural context compared to the previous site.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O14802 261):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14802 261), depth (6.03), absolute_sasa (15.72), hse_up (25), hse_down (21), coord_number (46), rsa (0.35), h_nho1 (-0.3), h_ohn1 (-0.3), h_nho2 (-0.3), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (0.656), kappa (94), alpha (62.1), phi (-73.8), psi (-13.4), struct_motif (G), pocket (0), interface (TRUE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0.33), aliphatic (0.67), aromatic (0), KB05 (36.54), KB03 (49.62), KB02 (29.67).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O14802 261, located at a depth of 6.03 units, has a relatively high solvent-accessible surface area (15.72) and a high relative surface area (0.35), suggesting a partially buried location with 46 coordinating atoms, and forms part of a Glycine (G) structural motif;
