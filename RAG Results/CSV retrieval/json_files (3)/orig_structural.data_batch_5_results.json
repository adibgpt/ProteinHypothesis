        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: A6NHR9 505):**  Site A6NHR9 residue 505 is deeply buried (depth: 4.2004) with no solvent-accessible surface area (absolute_sasa: 0), exhibiting a high coordination number (38) and balanced hydrogen bonding (hse_up: 19, hse_down: 19).  Its backbone conformation is a glycine (struct_motif: G) with specific dihedral angles (phi: -73.5, psi: -32.3) and secondary structure propensities (alpha: 63.8, kappa: 87.1).  It's not part of an interface (interface: FALSE) and has a balanced composition of basic and aliphatic amino acids (basic: 0.2, aliphatic: 0.2).  The low TCO value (0.836) suggests a less ordered structure.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 values (59.396, 62.681, 50.110 respectively) are relatively high, indicating specific interactions.  Summary: This residue is deeply buried, highly coordinated, and has a glycine conformation suggesting a specific role within the protein core.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00139 199):**  Residue 199 of site O00139 is located at a shallow depth (depth: 1.926) with significant solvent exposure (absolute_sasa: 84.79).  It has a lower coordination number (16) and an imbalanced hydrogen bonding environment (hse_up: 2, hse_down: 14), forming a helical structure (struct_motif: H) with dihedral angles (phi: -65.8, psi: -46.5) and secondary structure propensities (alpha: 54.6, kappa: 107.4).  It is not part of an interface (interface: FALSE) and has a slightly acidic amino acid composition (acidic: 0.333).  Its KB values are lower than row 1 (KB05: 29.764, KB03: 35.608, KB02: 8.650), suggesting different interactions.  Summary: This surface-exposed residue is part of a helix with fewer interactions compared to the deeply buried residue in row 1.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: A6NHR9 474):** Site A6NHR9 residue 474 has a moderate depth (depth: 3.0008) and is buried (absolute_sasa: 0), with a high coordination number (41) and nearly balanced hydrogen bonding (hse_up: 20, hse_down: 21). It adopts an extended conformation (struct_motif: E), characterized by unusual dihedral angles (phi: -123.4, psi: 132.7) and negative alpha and kappa values (alpha: -167.3, kappa: 18.5). It is not part of an interface (interface: FALSE), and has a primarily aliphatic composition (aliphatic: 0.5).  The negative TCO value (-0.93) suggests a disordered structure.  KB values are intermediate (KB05: 46.458, KB03: 56.604, KB02: 45.351). Summary: This residue is buried, highly coordinated, and adopts an unusual extended conformation, potentially representing a loop or disordered region.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: A6NHR9 492):** Site A6NHR9 residue 492 is moderately buried (depth: 3.473) with low solvent exposure (absolute_sasa: 2.143), possessing a moderate coordination number (35) and slightly imbalanced hydrogen bonding (hse_up: 19, hse_down: 16). It has a glycine conformation (struct_motif: G) with dihedral angles (phi: -130.7, psi: 31.2) and secondary structure propensities (alpha: 90.3, kappa: 92.8). It's not part of an interface (interface: FALSE) and is predominantly aromatic (aromatic: 0.6).  Its KB values are intermediate (KB05: 48.782, KB03: 49.653, KB02: 38.545). Summary: This residue is partially buried, with a glycine conformation and a high proportion of aromatic amino acids, suggesting potential involvement in interactions with other aromatic residues.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: A6NHR9 84):** Residue 84 of site A6NHR9 is located at a shallow depth (depth: 1.773) with high solvent exposure (absolute_sasa: 104.6). It has a lower coordination number (18) and imbalanced hydrogen bonding (hse_up: 2, hse_down: 16), adopting a turn conformation (struct_motif: T) with dihedral angles (phi: -60.2, psi: -36.7) and secondary structure propensities (alpha: 51.9, kappa: 119.8). It is not part of an interface (interface: FALSE) and has a composition of acidic and polar amino acids (acidic: 0.333, polar: 0.333). Its KB values are relatively high (KB05: 44.669, KB03: 47.949, KB02: 45.583). Summary: This surface-exposed residue is part of a turn, with a mix of acidic and polar amino acids suggesting potential involvement in interactions with the solvent or other polar residues.\n"
