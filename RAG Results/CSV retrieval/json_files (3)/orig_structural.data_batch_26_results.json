        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a true CSV file, so the \"column names\" are the keys.\n\n\n**Row 1: site: O00629 417**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00629 417, depth: 4.71320671, absolute_sasa: 1.286796351, hse_up: 18, hse_down: 24, coord_number: 42, rsa: 0.005988024, h_nho1: -2.6, h_ohn1: -2.2, h_nho2: -0.2, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: 0.837, kappa: 100.1, alpha: 67.1, phi: -70.7, psi: -32.8, struct_motif: H, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0, polar: 0.166666667, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.5, aliphatic: 0.166666667, aromatic: 0.166666667, KB05: 54.55608821, KB03: 63.74357919, KB02: 43.41595227\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:**  Site O00629, residue 417, exhibits a deep location (depth 4.71) with very low solvent accessibility (absolute_sasa 1.29) and a high coordination number (42), suggesting a buried, highly interacting residue; its  H-bond parameters (h_nho1, h_ohn1, etc.) and dihedral angles (phi, psi) indicate a specific secondary structure (struct_motif H), characterized by a relatively high KB03 value (63.74).\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue is deeply buried within the protein structure, with extensive interactions indicated by its high coordination number and low solvent accessibility.  The characteristics suggest it plays a crucial role in maintaining the protein's core structure.\n\n\n**Row 2: site: O00763 365**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00763 365, depth: 1.836355941, absolute_sasa: 90.05056156, hse_up: 13, hse_down: 13, coord_number: 26, rsa: 0.502994012, h_nho1: -1.9, h_ohn1: -1.6, h_nho2: -0.3, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: 0.866, kappa: 104.9, alpha: 60.1, phi: -62.2, psi: -35.1, struct_motif: H, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0.2, acidic: 0, polar: 0.2, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.2, aliphatic: 0.4, aromatic: 0, KB05: 26.15405034, KB03: 31.02377121, KB02: 28.39066791\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:**  Site O00763, residue 365, shows a relatively shallow depth (1.84) and high surface accessibility (absolute_sasa 90.05), with moderate coordination number (26) and RSA (0.50), suggesting exposure to solvent; it has a helical structure (struct_motif H), a moderate proportion of aliphatic residues, and relatively lower KB values compared to Row 1.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue is significantly more exposed to the solvent than the residue in Row 1, indicated by the higher absolute SASA and RSA values.  Its properties suggest a role potentially involved in interactions with other molecules or the surrounding environment.\n\n\n**Row 3: site: O00629 325**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00629 325, depth: 1.847494906, absolute_sasa: 29.32618937, hse_up: 18, hse_down: 6, coord_number: 24, rsa: 0.173652695, h_nho1: -1.4, h_ohn1: -0.3, h_nho2: -0.5, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: 0.129, kappa: 122.4, alpha: -104.1, phi: -86.9, psi: 19.4, struct_motif: T, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0.166666667, polar: 0.166666667, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.166666667, aliphatic: 0.5, aromatic: 0, KB05: 47.60088294, KB03: 58.70547307, KB02: 38.178682\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Site O00629, residue 325, has a shallow depth (1.85) and moderate surface accessibility (absolute_sasa 29.33), a turn structure (struct_motif T), with a higher proportion of aliphatic residues and a negative alpha angle indicating a turn structure.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue is partially exposed to the solvent, and its turn structure suggests a role in connecting different secondary structure elements within the protein.\n\n\n**Row 4: site: O00764 112**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00764 112, depth: 6.795957113, absolute_sasa: 0, hse_up: 22, hse_down: 24, coord_number: 46, rsa: 0, h_nho1: -3.4, h_ohn1: -1.2, h_nho2: -0.7, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: -0.942, kappa: 21.6, alpha: -165.2, phi: -115.1, psi: 123.5, struct_motif: E, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0.166666667, polar: 0.166666667, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.166666667, aliphatic: 0.333333333, aromatic: 0.166666667, KB05: 26.74146183, KB03: 25.42997102, KB02: 9.594180949\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Site O00764, residue 112, is deeply buried (depth 6.80) with zero solvent accessibility (absolute_sasa 0), a high coordination number (46), and a extended structure (struct_motif E), characterized by unusual phi and psi angles and a low kappa value, suggesting a significant deviation from ideal secondary structure.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue is completely buried and exhibits a highly unusual conformation, potentially indicating a unique structural role or a region of high flexibility.\n\n\n**Row 5: site: O00629 456**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** site: O00629 456, depth: 1.811909388, absolute_sasa: 36.74200679, hse_up: 21, hse_down: 2, coord_number: 23, rsa: 0.203592814, h_nho1: -1.4, h_ohn1: -0.3, h_nho2: -0.4, h_ohn2: -0.2, tco: 0.735, kappa: 115, alpha: -114.6, phi: -60.1, psi: -26.2, struct_motif: H, pocket: 0, interface: FALSE, basic: 0, acidic: 0.25, polar: 0, cysteine: 0, structural: 0.75, aliphatic: 0, aromatic: 0, KB05: 41.08943872, KB03: 46.3198081, KB02: 22.01743349\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** Site O00629, residue 456, is relatively shallow (depth 1.81) with moderate surface accessibility (absolute_sasa 36.74), a helical structure (struct_motif H), and a high proportion of structural residues, but a low number of hydrogen bonds, suggesting a more exposed helical segment that is predominantly structural in nature.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This residue, while somewhat exposed, has a primarily structural role due to its high proportion of structural residues and helical conformation.  The relatively low number of hydrogen bonds might indicate a less tightly packed region within the helix.\n"
