        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as text and not a true CSV, making some aspects of automated analysis difficult.  The analysis will focus on interpreting the given values.\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O14672 639):**\n\nSite O14672, residue 639, is buried (depth 3.52, absolute_sasa 0), with a high coordination number (35) suggesting extensive interactions.  HSE up and down values (17 and 18 respectively) indicate a balanced hydrogen bonding environment.  The residue displays low polarity (acidic, polar, basic values near 0), a high cysteine content (0.29), and some structural character (0.29).  It's not located at an interface and doesn't belong to a pocket. Its backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi, alpha) suggest a specific conformation (E struct_motif), and various other calculated values (kappa, tco, KB02, KB03, KB05) provide additional structural information.  Summary: This residue is deeply buried, highly coordinated, and characterized by a high cysteine content within a specific secondary structure motif.\n\n**Row 2 (site: O14727 1129):**\n\nSite O14727, residue 1129, is exposed on the surface (depth 2.58, absolute_sasa 36.03) and located at an interface.  It has a moderate coordination number (32), and relatively balanced HSE values (14 and 18). It exhibits a relatively high proportion of basic amino acids (0.4) and a moderate proportion of acidic and structural amino acids.  The lack of polar and cysteine residues is notable, with aliphatic residues making up 20%. Its backbone dihedral angles and structural motif (N/A) suggest a less defined secondary structure. Various calculated values (kappa, tco, KB02, KB03, KB05) provide additional structural information. Summary: This surface-exposed residue at an interface is characterized by a high proportion of basic amino acids and a lack of polar and cysteine residues.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O14684 137):**\n\nSite O14684, residue 137, is buried (depth 3.16, absolute_sasa 0), with a high coordination number (41).  It has a slightly unbalanced HSE (21 up, 20 down), indicating a slight preference for upward hydrogen bonds.  It shows a high proportion of polar amino acids (0.4) and a moderate proportion of structural and aliphatic amino acids.  It is not located at an interface and is not part of a pocket. Its backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi, alpha) suggest a specific conformation (H struct_motif). Various calculated values (kappa, tco, KB02, KB03, KB05) provide additional structural information. Summary: This deeply buried residue is highly coordinated and contains a high proportion of polar and aliphatic amino acids within a defined secondary structure.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O14684 59):**\n\nSite O14684, residue 59, is exposed (depth 2.05, absolute_sasa 53.98) and displays a moderate coordination number (24). It has relatively balanced HSE values (11 and 13), and exhibits a balanced composition of basic, structural, aliphatic and aromatic amino acids (all around 0.25).  No polar or cysteine residues are present. The lack of interface and pocket association is notable.  Its backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi, alpha) suggest a specific conformation (B struct_motif). Various calculated values (kappa, tco, KB02, KB03, KB05) provide additional structural information. Summary: This exposed residue shows a balanced composition of amino acid types and a defined secondary structure.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O14727 115):**\n\nSite O14727, residue 115, is highly exposed (depth 1.80, absolute_sasa 108.18), with a low coordination number (23). It has slightly unbalanced HSE values (12 up, 11 down), and shows a moderate proportion of acidic and polar amino acids (0.25 each). A high proportion of aliphatic amino acids (0.5) is notable. It's located in a pocket (765). Its backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi, alpha) suggest a specific conformation (T struct_motif). Various calculated values (kappa, tco, KB02, KB03, KB05) provide additional structural information. Summary: This highly exposed residue within a pocket is characterized by a high proportion of aliphatic amino acids and a defined secondary structure.\n"
