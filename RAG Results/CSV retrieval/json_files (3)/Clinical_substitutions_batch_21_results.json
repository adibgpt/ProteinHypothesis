        "response": "The provided text is not a CSV file; it's a collection of data entries.  Each entry consists of a protein ID (NP_000008.1), a wild-type protein sequence, a mutant protein sequence resulting from a specific amino acid substitution (e.g., R325W, meaning Arginine at position 325 is replaced with Tryptophan), and an annotation classifying the mutation as \"Pathogenic\".  For example, one entry shows that the substitution of Arginine at position 325 with Tryptophan in protein NP_000008.1 is annotated as pathogenic.  All provided entries share the same protein ID and wild-type sequence, differing only in the specific amino acid substitution and its resulting pathogenic annotation.  The data suggests that these specific mutations in this protein are all deleterious.\n"
