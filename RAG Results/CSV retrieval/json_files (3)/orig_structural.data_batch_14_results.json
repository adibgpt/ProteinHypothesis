        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a true CSV, so the analysis is adapted accordingly.\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00329 718):**\n\nSite O00329 718 exhibits a depth of 2.35, an absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 18.63, with 13 HSE up and 11 HSE down, resulting in a coordination number of 24 and a relative solvent-accessible surface area (RSA) of 0.096.  Hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) suggest moderate hydrogen bonding (-1.2, -0.3, -0.2, -0.2), a torsion correlation of 0.83, and backbone dihedral angles (kappa, alpha, phi, psi) indicating a helical structure (113.5, 48.6, -61.3, -33.9).  It's classified as a helical (H) structural motif, not located in a pocket, not at an interface, and is primarily aliphatic (0.5). KB scores (KB05, KB03, KB02) suggest a moderate level of interaction potential.  Summary: This residue is buried, has moderate hydrogen bonding, and displays characteristics of an alpha helix.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00329 474):**\n\nSite O00329 474, with a depth of 2.54 and absolute ASA of 30.67, has 11 HSE up and 15 HSE down, yielding a coordination number of 26 and RSA of 0.15.  It shows weak hydrogen bonding (-1.9, -2.5, -0.3, -0.2), a negative torsion correlation (-0.97), and dihedral angles indicating an extended structure (3.1, -151, -141.3, 124.9), classified as an extended (E) motif, not in a pocket or at an interface, and showing a mixture of acidic and aliphatic properties.  Low KB scores suggest weak interaction potential. Summary: This residue is relatively buried, shows weak hydrogen bonding, and displays characteristics of an extended strand with some acidic character.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00329 366):**\n\nSite O00329 366 is shallow (depth 1.96) with a large ASA (50.94), 7 HSE up and 18 HSE down, a coordination number of 25, and a high RSA (0.30).  It has weak hydrogen bonding (-0.3, -0.1, -0.1, 0), a negative torsion correlation (-0.94), and dihedral angles suggesting an extended or loop conformation (66.4, -101.5, -161, 167.6). It's located at an interface, and has a mix of polar and structural characteristics, with moderate KB scores.  Summary: This surface residue is at an interface, with weak hydrogen bonding and a less-defined secondary structure.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00329 438):**\n\nSite O00329 438 has a depth of 1.83 and a large ASA (53.33), with 7 HSE up and 19 HSE down, resulting in a coordination number of 26 and high RSA (0.30).  It exhibits weak hydrogen bonding (-0.3, -0.8, -0.2, -0.2), a negative torsion correlation (-0.91), and dihedral angles suggesting an extended structure (16.1, -162.7, -112.5, 100), classified as an extended (E) motif, not in a pocket or at an interface, and is primarily aliphatic and aromatic. Moderate KB scores are observed. Summary: This surface residue is mostly aliphatic and aromatic, with a tendency towards an extended conformation.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00329 219):**\n\nSite O00329 219 is shallow (depth 1.90) with a large ASA (59.95), 12 HSE up and 14 HSE down, a coordination number of 26, and a high RSA (0.35). It shows moderate to weak hydrogen bonding (-0.8, -2.4, -0.7, -0.2), a positive torsion correlation (0.88), and dihedral angles suggesting a helical structure (112.2, 44.8, -76, -42.1), classified as a helical (H) motif, not in a pocket or at an interface, and is purely aliphatic. High KB scores are observed. Summary: This mostly exposed, aliphatic residue exhibits characteristics of an alpha helix, with moderate hydrogen bonding.\n"
