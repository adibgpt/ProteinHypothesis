        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data appears to be from a protein structure analysis, but without knowing the exact meaning of each column, interpretations are limited to describing relationships between the given values.\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00299 223):**\n\nSite O00299 residue 223 has a depth of 2.038, an absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 25.49, HSE up and down values of 20 and 19 respectively, a coordination number of 39, and a relative solvent-accessible surface area (RSA) of 0.138.  The hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) show relatively weak hydrogen bonding, and the torsion angles (kappa, alpha, phi, psi) suggest a particular conformation. The site is classified as a P structural motif, with low polarity, a balanced distribution of structural, aliphatic, and aromatic components, and low KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores indicating potential interactions.  This residue appears to be buried within the protein structure, exhibiting a significant number of interactions with surrounding residues.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00299 89):**\n\nSite O00299 residue 89 exhibits a depth of 1.896, a higher absolute ASA of 46.12, and lower HSE up and down values (7 and 13) compared to residue 223, resulting in a coordination number of 20 and a higher RSA of 0.317, suggesting higher solvent exposure.  The hydrogen bond scores indicate weaker hydrogen bonds than residue 223,  and the structural motif is listed as N/A. It has a higher aliphatic character and notably lower KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores than residue 223. This residue is less buried and shows fewer interactions than residue 223.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00299 59):**\n\nResidue 59 at site O00299 shows a depth of 2.119, a very low absolute ASA of 9.78, HSE up and down values of 17 and 8, a coordination number of 25, and a very low RSA of 0.03, suggesting it's deeply buried.  Hydrogen bond scores point to stronger hydrogen bonds, particularly h_nho1 and h_ohn1, and the structural motif is N/A. It shows a low polarity and a higher structural component, and significantly higher KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores compared to residues 223 and 89.  This residue is deeply buried and appears to be involved in strong interactions.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00299 178):**\n\nResidue 178 at site O00299 has a significant depth of 4.798, a zero absolute ASA, high HSE values (24 and 20), a high coordination number (44), and a zero RSA, indicating a fully buried location. The hydrogen bond scores suggest weak interactions, and the site is classified as an H structural motif, showing a balanced distribution of basic, acidic, and polar components, and a high proportion of aliphatic components.  The KB scores show a wide range, with KB03 being significantly higher than KB05 and KB02.  This deeply buried residue shows a high degree of interaction with neighboring residues.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00299 191):**\n\nResidue 191 at site O00299 has a depth of 5.062, a very low absolute ASA of 2.42, high HSE values (17 and 17), a coordination number of 34, and a zero RSA, signifying a completely buried location.  It displays relatively strong hydrogen bonds, especially h_nho1 and h_ohn1, and is classified as an H structural motif.  It has a high proportion of basic and aliphatic components.  Importantly, it shows extremely high KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores, suggesting strong and potentially significant interactions.  This residue is also deeply buried and exhibits very strong interactions.\n"
