        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1:**  Site O14545 at position 109 has a depth of 2.23, zero absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA), 16 HSE up and 9 HSE down, a coordination number of 25, and a relative solvent-accessible surface area (RSA) of 0.01.  Its hydrogen bond scores (H_NHO1, H_OHN1, H_NHO2, H_OHN2) are -3.2, -0.4, -0.3, and -0.3 respectively, indicating potential hydrogen bond interactions. The torsion angles (kappa, alpha, phi, psi) are 104.9, 40.6, -37, and -54.7 degrees, suggesting a specific secondary structure (struct_motif H).  It has a TCO of 0.88, is not located in a pocket or at an interface, and exhibits a composition of 33.3% basic, 16.7% acidic, 16.7% structural, and 16.7% aliphatic and aromatic residues.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores are 9.11, 13.83, and 8.94 respectively.  This site is buried (low ASA and RSA), likely involved in core packing interactions due to its high coordination number and hydrogen bonding.\n\n**Row 2:** Site O14579 at position 34 shows a depth of 5.31, zero absolute ASA, 22 HSE up and 13 HSE down, and a coordination number of 35, with zero RSA. Hydrogen bond scores are -2, -2.3, -0.2, and -0.2, and torsion angles are 111.5, 46.6, -58.8, and -51 degrees, indicating a helical structure (struct_motif H).  Its TCO is 0.98. The site is not in a pocket or interface and consists of 14.3% acidic, 28.6% polar, and 57.1% aliphatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores are 22.25, 23.82, and 24.78, indicating a higher propensity for interaction compared to row 1.  This deeply buried site with high coordination number suggests a crucial role in protein stability.\n\n**Row 3:** Site O14545 at position 83 displays a depth of 1.55, a high absolute ASA of 115.55, 1 HSE up and 6 HSE down, and a coordination number of only 7, with an RSA of 0.65. Hydrogen bond scores are -0.4, -1.1, -0.1, and 0, and torsion angles are 33.5, -95.8, -98.5, and 153.1 degrees, indicating a non-standard secondary structure (struct_motif N/A).  Its TCO is -0.67. The site is not in a pocket or interface and is composed of 50% acidic and 50% structural residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores are 14.58, 29.48, and 22.48 respectively.  This site, with high ASA and low coordination number, is likely exposed to the solvent and potentially involved in interactions with other molecules.\n\n**Row 4:** Site O14531 at position 90 has a depth of 2.29, an absolute ASA of 40.46, 8 HSE up and 26 HSE down, and a coordination number of 34, with an RSA of 0.20.  Hydrogen bond scores are -0.2, -1.7, -0.2, and -0.2, and torsion angles are 119.3, 38.1, -69, and -52.2 degrees, suggesting a helical structure (struct_motif H).  Its TCO is 0.95. The site is not in a pocket or interface and has a composition of 16.7% acidic, 33.3% polar, 16.7% structural, 16.7% aliphatic, and 16.7% aromatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores are 12.01, 27.38, and 9.67 respectively.  This site, with moderate ASA and a high coordination number, suggests a role in both structural integrity and potential interactions.\n\n**Row 5:** Site O14545 at position 135 has a depth of 2.27, an absolute ASA of 15.22, 16 HSE up and 7 HSE down, and a coordination number of 23, with an RSA of 0.11.  Hydrogen bond scores are -2.1, -0.1, -0.2, and 0, and torsion angles are 88.2, 11.2, -72.6, and 110.3 degrees, indicating a beta-sheet structure (struct_motif B). Its TCO is -0.58. The site is not in a pocket or interface and consists of 20% basic, 20% cysteine, and 40% structural and 20% aliphatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 scores are 11.93, 11.33, and 7.10 respectively. This site has low ASA and is likely involved in structural interactions, potentially including disulfide bonds due to the presence of cysteine.\n"
