        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a CSV file, so the formatting is slightly different.  Also, some interpretations are limited due to the lack of context on what the values represent.\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O14641 354):**\n\nSite O14641 at position 354 exhibits a depth of 1.99, an absolute solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of 38.29,  with 21 hydrogen bonds up and 10 down, resulting in a coordination number of 31 and a relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of 0.35.  The hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) suggest moderate hydrogen bonding interactions, and the torsion angles (kappa, alpha, phi, psi) indicate a specific conformation. The amino acid composition shows a balanced distribution of basic, acidic, polar, and structural residues, with some aromatic character.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest specific properties related to this site. The summary: This residue is moderately buried, has significant interactions, and shows a relatively balanced amino acid composition.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O14593 205):**\n\nSite O14593 at position 205 is deeply buried (depth 3.10), having no solvent-accessible surface area (absolute_sasa 0), and possesses 23 hydrogen bonds up and 15 down, leading to a high coordination number (38) and very low RSA (0.006).  The hydrogen bond scores reveal strong interactions, particularly with h_ohn1 (-2.5), and the torsion angles suggest a different conformation than site O14641 354.  The amino acid composition is rich in aliphatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values indicate distinct properties from the previous site. Summary: This deeply buried residue exhibits strong hydrogen bonding interactions and a primarily aliphatic composition.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O14646 1176):**\n\nSite O14646 at position 1176 shows a depth of 2.38, a small absolute SASA (5.98), 13 hydrogen bonds up and 16 down, resulting in a coordination number of 29 and a low RSA (0.018). The hydrogen bond scores indicate strong interactions, particularly with h_nho1 (-2.2) and h_ohn1 (-2). Torsion angles are similar to site O14593 205. The amino acid composition is primarily aliphatic. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest this site has distinct properties. Summary: This residue is relatively buried, shows strong hydrogen bonding, and is composed mainly of aliphatic residues.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O14646 1242):**\n\nSite O14646 at position 1242 has a depth of 1.96, a moderate absolute SASA (26.73), 13 hydrogen bonds up and 9 down, a coordination number of 22, and a higher RSA (0.14).  Hydrogen bonding is weak (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2 near zero). Torsion angles (kappa, alpha, phi, psi) show a different conformation.  The amino acid composition includes basic and structural residues and some aliphatic character. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are lower than in the previous sites. Summary: This residue is moderately exposed, exhibits weak hydrogen bonding, and has a composition including basic and structural residues.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O14646 411):**\n\nSite O14646 at position 411 is deeply buried (depth 5.79), with no solvent-accessible surface area (absolute_sasa 0), 24 hydrogen bonds up and 15 down, leading to a high coordination number (39) and zero RSA.  The hydrogen bond scores show strong interactions, especially h_nho1 (-3.2) and h_ohn1 (-1.6). Torsion angles display a unique conformation.  The amino acid composition includes basic, polar, cysteine, aliphatic, and aromatic residues.  KB05, KB03, and KB02 values fall within a certain range. Summary: This deeply buried residue shows very strong hydrogen bonding and a diverse amino acid composition.\n"
