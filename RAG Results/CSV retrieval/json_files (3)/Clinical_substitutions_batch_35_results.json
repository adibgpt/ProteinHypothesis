For example, the first record shows that the protein with ID NP_000009.1, having a specific long protein sequence, undergoes a mutation from Glycine to Cysteine at position 439, resulting in a pathogenic change.  This pattern repeats for each record, indicating that each described mutation in the protein sequence of NP_000009.1 is annotated as pathogenic.\n"
