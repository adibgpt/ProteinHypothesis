        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00410 687):**\n\nSite O00410 687 exhibits a depth of 2.36, an absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 34.74, HSE up and down values of 15, a coordination number of 30, and a relative solvent-accessible surface area (RSA) of 0.19.  Its hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) are -1, -3.1, -0.2, and -0.3 respectively, indicating potential hydrogen bonding interactions. The torsional angles (tco, kappa, alpha, phi, psi) are 0.92, 109.3, 47.8, -69.4, and -43.9 degrees.  It's classified as a helix (struct_motif: H), not located in a pocket or interface, and has a composition of 16.7% basic, 16.7% acidic, 50% aliphatic, and 16.7% aromatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 66.96, 70.02, and 58.76 respectively.  This residue is relatively exposed to solvent, has a moderate number of contacts, and shows characteristics of a typical helical structure within the protein.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00410 944):**\n\nSite O00410 944, buried within the protein (depth 4.45, absolute ASA 0, RSA 0), has HSE up and down values of 25 and 14, and a coordination number of 39 suggesting a tightly packed environment. Hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) are -1.3, -1.2, -1.2, and -0.2, indicating potential hydrogen bonding.  Torsional angles (tco, kappa, alpha, phi, psi) are 0.85, 107, 48.9, -75.8, and -34.5 degrees.  It is also a helix (struct_motif: H), not in a pocket or interface, and composed of 16.7% polar, 16.7% cysteine, 16.7% structural, 33.3% aliphatic, and 16.7% aromatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 35.20, 44.09, and 31.62. This residue is deeply buried and highly coordinated, typical of a core helical residue.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00410 733):**\n\nSite O00410 733 is buried (depth 3.07, absolute ASA 0, RSA 0), with HSE up and down values of 21 and 13, and a coordination number of 34.  Hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) are -1.2, -1.4, -0.2, and -0.2, indicating hydrogen bonding.  Its torsional angles (tco, kappa, alpha, phi, psi) are 0.96, 112.1, 50.8, -72.2, and -55.1 degrees.  This is another helix (struct_motif: H), not in a pocket or interface, and composed of 40% acidic, 60% aliphatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 55.56, 56.51, and 38.06 respectively. This buried helix is characterized by a high proportion of aliphatic residues.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00410 915):**\n\nSite O00410 915 has a depth of 1.91, a high absolute ASA of 63.48, and an RSA of 0.38, indicating significant surface exposure.  HSE up and down values are 9 and 23, with a coordination number of 32.  Hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) are -1.5, -0.3, -0.2, and -0.2. Torsional angles (tco, kappa, alpha, phi, psi) are 0.23, 86.9, 139.4, -101.6, and 6.2 degrees, indicating a turn structure.  It's a turn (struct_motif: T), not in a pocket or interface, and is composed of 50% acidic and 50% aliphatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 56.86, 17.01, and 5.61 respectively.  This residue is highly exposed on the protein surface and adopts a turn conformation.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00410 682):**\n\nSite O00410 682 is buried (depth 4.60, absolute ASA 0, RSA 0), with HSE up and down values of 27 and 19, and a coordination number of 46, suggesting a highly packed environment.  Hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) are -2.2, -1.9, -0.2, and -0.2. Torsional angles (tco, kappa, alpha, phi, psi) are 0.94, 110.3, 49.2, -67.6, and -42.3 degrees.  It is a helix (struct_motif: H), not in a pocket or interface, and composed of 28.6% polar and 71.4% aliphatic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are 66.96, 70.02, and 58.76 respectively.  This deeply buried helix is characterized by a high proportion of aliphatic residues.\n\n"
