        "response": "Here's an analysis of each row, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1:**  Site O00170 at position 208 shows a depth of 2.0017, a relatively low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 19.94,  16 HSEs (hydrogen side chain environment) above and 14 below, a coordination number of 30, and a relative solvent-accessible surface area (RSA) of 0.11.  Its hydrophobicity scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) indicate a mostly hydrophobic environment, with a torsional correlation parameter (TCO) of 0.97, and dihedral angles (kappa, alpha, phi, psi) suggesting a specific secondary structure (H).  The site is non-pocketed and not at an interface, with a predominantly aliphatic composition (60%). KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest moderate binding affinity.  **Summary:** This site displays characteristics of a buried, relatively hydrophobic residue within a protein, potentially involved in core packing.\n\n\n**Row 2:** Site O00194 at position 123 has a depth of 1.87, a high ASA of 74.56, 6 HSEs above and 14 below, a coordination number of 20, and an RSA of 0.41.  Its hydrophobicity is low, with a TCO of 0.78, and dihedral angles indicating a turn (T) structure. This site is non-pocketed and not at an interface, exhibiting a mixed composition of basic, acidic, and cysteine residues (20% each) along with aliphatic and aromatic residues. KB values suggest weaker binding affinity compared to Row 1. **Summary:** This site is more exposed to solvent, less hydrophobic, and structurally distinct from Row 1, potentially located on the protein surface with some level of interaction with other molecules.\n\n\n**Row 3:** Site O00170 at position 90 exhibits a depth of 3.78, a very low ASA of 0, 17 HSEs above and below, a coordination number of 34, and an RSA of 0.  Its hydrophobicity shows a slightly polar environment, a negative TCO (-0.99), and dihedral angles indicating a disordered region (N/A).  It\u2019s non-pocketed, not at an interface, and predominantly aliphatic and aromatic (60% and 20% respectively). High KB values suggest strong binding affinity. **Summary:** This deeply buried site is completely inaccessible to solvent and shows a disordered structure, possibly indicating a critical role in protein stability or function, potentially a binding site due to high KB values.\n\n\n**Row 4:** Site O00189 at position 416 has a depth of 2.08, a low ASA of 8.07, 25 HSEs above and 17 below, a coordination number of 42, and a low RSA of 0.03.  Its hydrophobicity scores are low, with a TCO of 0.87, and dihedral angles suggesting a strand (S) structure.  It's non-pocketed and not at an interface, with a mixed composition including polar residues (40%).  High KB values suggest strong binding affinity. **Summary:**  This site is partially buried, relatively hydrophobic, and shows a secondary structure element, suggesting a role in protein structure and potentially interaction with other molecules due to high KB values and polar composition.\n\n\n**Row 5:** Site O00170 at position 254 displays a depth of 4.85, a very low ASA of 0, 24 HSEs above and 16 below, a coordination number of 40, and an RSA of 0.  Its hydrophobicity scores are largely hydrophobic, with a TCO of 0.92, and dihedral angles suggesting a helix (H) structure. It's non-pocketed, not at an interface, and largely aliphatic.  Low KB values compared to others suggest weaker binding affinity. **Summary:** This deeply buried, completely solvent-inaccessible site has a helical structure and is highly hydrophobic. Its low KB values might suggest a role less directly involved in binding compared to other sites.\n"
