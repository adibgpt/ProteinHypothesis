        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a true CSV file, so the analysis is based on the assumption that each block represents a row in a hypothetical CSV.\n\n**Row 1 (site: O14744 278):**  Site O14744 at position 278 shows a depth of 1.77, a relatively high absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 68.61, with 6 HSE (hydrogen side chain environment) up and 18 down, and a coordination number of 24; its relative solvent-accessible surface area (RSA) is 0.41, indicating significant exposure, and its backbone torsion angles (phi, psi) are -59.6 and -22.2 degrees respectively.  Hydrogen bond parameters (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) suggest some hydrogen bonding interactions.  The site is classified as a helical (H) structural motif and has a relatively high KB05 value (68.70). In summary, this residue is located relatively near the surface, is well-exposed to solvent, and exhibits characteristics of a typical alpha-helix.\n\n**Row 2 (site: O14733 260):** Site O14733 at position 260 has a depth of 2.87, a low absolute ASA (18.91), a high coordination number (43), and a low RSA (0.11), suggesting it's buried within the protein.  It has a high number of HSE up (18) and down (25), indicating extensive interactions. Its backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi) are -139.8 and -178.5 degrees, and it's located within a pocket (322.625). The site lacks a defined secondary structure motif (N/A) and has moderate KB03 and KB02 values (73.82 and 54.62 respectively). In summary, this residue is deeply buried, highly coordinated, and likely involved in extensive interactions within the protein core.\n\n**Row 3 (site: O14744 22):** Site O14744 at position 22 exhibits a depth of 1.96, a moderate absolute ASA (23.41), a high coordination number (44), and a high RSA (0.56), suggesting partial exposure. It's located at a protein interface and possesses a pocket volume of 357.25.  The backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi) are -132.9 and 113 degrees, and it lacks a defined secondary structure motif (N/A).  In summary, this surface residue participates in protein-protein interactions.\n\n**Row 4 (site: O14733 280):** Site O14733 at position 280 displays a depth of 2.19, a moderate absolute ASA (39.99), a coordination number of 26, and a low RSA (0.24), indicating partial burial.  It lacks a defined secondary structure (N/A) and is not located at an interface. In summary, this residue is partially buried and has a moderate level of interaction with its surroundings.\n\n**Row 5 (site: O14744 196):** Site O14744 at position 196 has a depth of 3.79, a very low absolute ASA (2.14), a coordination number of 37, and a very low RSA (0.02), indicating it is deeply buried. It's classified as a turn (T) structural motif and is not located at an interface. In summary, this residue is deeply buried within the protein core and likely plays a structural role.\n"
