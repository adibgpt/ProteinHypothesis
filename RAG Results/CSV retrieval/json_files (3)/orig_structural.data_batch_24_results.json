        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00506 357):**  Site O00506 at position 357 exhibits a depth of 2.66, a relatively low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) of 6.04, and a coordination number of 28, suggesting a buried residue with extensive interactions.  HSE scores of 19 up and 9 down indicate a predominantly upward-facing orientation.  Its low RSA (0.02) further supports its buried nature.  The residue is characterized by negative H-bond scores (H_NHO1, H_OHN1, H_NHO2, H_OHN2), a moderate TCO of 0.61, and secondary structure motif 'H'.  It shows a low percentage of acidic and a moderate percentage of polar residues. The KB scores (KB05, KB03, KB02) indicate  moderate to high energy values.  In summary, this site represents a deeply buried, highly interacting residue in an alpha-helical structure with limited solvent exposure.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00499 47):** Site O00499 at position 47 has a depth of 1.88 and a significantly higher absolute ASA of 28.87, indicating a more exposed location.  Its coordination number of 25 and RSA of 0.14 suggest moderate interaction.  HSE scores of 15 up and 10 down show a slightly upward-facing orientation.  The residue exhibits less negative H-bond scores compared to Row 1 and a higher TCO (0.885), and also has a secondary structure motif 'H'. It has a moderate percentage of polar and aliphatic residues, and a smaller percentage of aromatic residues.  The KB scores suggest moderate energy values.  In summary, this site represents a moderately exposed residue within an alpha-helix, with somewhat fewer interactions than the first site.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00483 44):**  Site O00483 at position 44 shows a depth of 2.24 and a high absolute ASA of 27.39, suggesting a moderately exposed location.  It has a high coordination number of 33, and a high RSA of 0.32, indicating extensive interactions.  HSE scores (19 up, 14 down) show a predominantly upward-facing orientation.  The residue exhibits slightly negative H-bond scores, a moderate TCO (0.603), and a secondary structure motif 'G', suggesting a glycine residue in a beta-turn.  It displays a mixture of basic and acidic residues, but no polar ones, and is composed of aliphatic and aromatic residues. The KB scores indicate high energy values. In summary, this site is a moderately exposed residue with numerous interactions, located in a beta-turn.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00481 511):** Site O00481 at position 511 shows a depth of 1.95 and a high absolute ASA of 31.51, suggesting a moderately exposed location.  A coordination number of 28 and RSA of 0.15 indicate moderate interaction.  HSE scores of 15 up and 13 down show a nearly equal distribution.  The residue has strongly negative H-bond scores for H_NHO1, and a low TCO (-0.682) and secondary structure motif 'P', indicating a proline residue. It has a high percentage of acidic and structural residues and moderate aliphatic residues, with no polar residues.  The KB scores are low. In summary, this site is a moderately exposed proline residue with moderate interactions, possibly in a turn or loop.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00541 361):** Site O00541 at position 361 has a depth of 1.97 and a very high absolute ASA of 66.87, indicating a highly exposed location.  It has a low coordination number of 16 and a high RSA of 0.34, suggesting fewer interactions.  HSE scores (8 up, 8 down) are evenly distributed.  The residue exhibits negative H-bond scores for H_NHO1, a low TCO (-0.958), and secondary structure motif 'S', indicating a random coil. It is composed of aliphatic and aromatic residues, with no polar residues.  The KB scores are high. In summary, this site represents a highly exposed residue with few interactions, located in a disordered region.\n"
