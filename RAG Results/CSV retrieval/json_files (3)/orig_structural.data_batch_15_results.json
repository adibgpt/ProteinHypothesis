There is no inherent relationship between the rows, other than that they all represent similar data points.\n\n\n**Row 1 (site: O00401 239):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00401 239), depth (2.370885427), absolute_sasa (7.68378271), hse_up (20), hse_down (8), coord_number (28), rsa (0.616766467), h_nho1 (-2.7), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.8), kappa (121.4), alpha (-104.8), phi (-68.5), psi (-25), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (TRUE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0.285714286), aliphatic (0.714285714), aromatic (0), KB05 (24.28907534), KB03 (23.87100181), KB02 (8.748301272).\n\nDescriptive sentence:  Site O00401 at position 239 shows a relatively shallow depth (2.37) and low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (7.68), with a high relative solvent accessibility (0.62) suggesting exposure;  it has 28 coordinating atoms and forms an interface (TRUE), exhibiting a helical (H) structural motif with predominantly aliphatic character (71.4%), and several hydrogen bond parameters (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_nho2, h_ohn2) indicating varied hydrogen bonding interactions.\n\nSummary: This site is located at the surface, possibly involved in interaction, and displays characteristics consistent with an alpha-helix.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O00329 991):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00329 991), depth (2.55034673), absolute_sasa (24.94424567), hse_up (5), hse_down (19), coord_number (24), rsa (0.125748503), h_nho1 (-0.1), h_ohn1 (-0.9), h_nho2 (0), h_ohn2 (-0.5), tco (-0.892), kappa (84.6), alpha (-76.4), phi (-158.7), psi (177.2), struct_motif (S), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.25), acidic (0.25), polar (0.5), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0), aromatic (0), KB05 (45.67303402), KB03 (74.6798999), KB02 (47.31238762).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00329 at position 991 exhibits a moderate depth (2.55) and higher absolute solvent-accessible surface area (24.94), a lower relative solvent accessibility (0.13), and 24 coordinating atoms;  it is not at an interface (FALSE), has a sheet (S) structural motif,  and demonstrates a balanced composition of basic (25%), acidic (25%), and polar (50%) residues, with no aliphatic or aromatic residues.\n\nSummary: This site is less exposed and has properties consistent with a beta-sheet; its amino acid composition suggests potential for polar interactions.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O00399 18):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00399 18), depth (1.887613691), absolute_sasa (33.38497628), hse_up (21), hse_down (8), coord_number (29), rsa (0.215568862), h_nho1 (-2.4), h_ohn1 (-2), h_nho2 (-0.6), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (-0.367), kappa (15.4), alpha (-125.4), phi (-65.1), psi (141.2), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.166666667), polar (0.166666667), cysteine (0), structural (0.166666667), aliphatic (0.5), aromatic (0), KB05 (57.31862413), KB03 (24.5893038), KB02 (16.91745571).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00399 at position 18 is shallow (1.89) with a large absolute solvent-accessible surface area (33.38), a moderate relative solvent accessibility (0.22), and 29 coordinating atoms; it's not at an interface (FALSE), has no defined structural motif (N/A), and contains a mixture of acidic, polar, structural, and aliphatic residues, with a predominance of aliphatic character (50%).\n\nSummary:  This surface site lacks a clear secondary structure assignment and shows a mixed composition of amino acid types.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O00329 90):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00329 90), depth (1.830316053), absolute_sasa (49.50436252), hse_up (13), hse_down (16), coord_number (29), rsa (0.28742515), h_nho1 (-1.9), h_ohn1 (-0.2), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.1), tco (0.842), kappa (107.8), alpha (49), phi (-67.1), psi (-32.3), struct_motif (H), pocket (590.375), interface (FALSE), basic (0.25), acidic (0.25), polar (0.25), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.25), aromatic (0), KB05 (58.63210795), KB03 (36.04205823), KB02 (20.59181703).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00329 at position 90 has a shallow depth (1.83) and a very large absolute solvent-accessible surface area (49.50), a high relative solvent accessibility (0.29), and 29 coordinating atoms; it is not at an interface (FALSE), displays a helical (H) structural motif,  and has a balanced composition of basic, acidic, polar, and aliphatic residues (25% each) and is located near a pocket (590.375).\n\nSummary: This highly exposed surface site is likely involved in interactions, and has a balanced amino acid composition. The proximity to a pocket is noteworthy.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O00391 237):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O00391 237), depth (5.134011615), absolute_sasa (1.286796351), hse_up (21), hse_down (19), coord_number (40), rsa (0), h_nho1 (-0.3), h_ohn1 (-3.3), h_ohn2 (-0.3), h_ohn2 (-0.4), tco (-0.986), kappa (12.4), alpha (-170.3), phi (-128.6), psi (130.5), struct_motif (E), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.166666667), acidic (0), polar (0.166666667), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.333333333), aromatic (0.333333333), KB05 (26.01051412), KB03 (26.75488288), KB02 (17.96740104).\n\nDescriptive sentence: Site O00391 at position 237 is deeply buried (5.13) with a very low absolute solvent-accessible surface area (1.29), and zero relative solvent accessibility (0), and 40 coordinating atoms; it's not at an interface (FALSE), has an extended (E) structural motif, and contains a mixture of basic, polar, aliphatic, and aromatic residues (with aliphatic and aromatic each at 33.3%).\n\nSummary: This site is deeply buried within the protein structure, and its amino acid composition suggests potential for interactions within the protein core.\n"
