        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is presented as a series of key-value pairs, not a true CSV file, so the \"column names\" are simply the keys.\n\n**Row 1 (site: O14672 607):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14672 607), depth (1.82), absolute_sasa (41.27), hse_up (12), hse_down (15), coord_number (27), rsa (0.23), h_nho1 (-1.1), h_ohn1 (-0.3), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (-0.59), kappa (26.7), alpha (152.9), phi (-75.7), psi (105.2), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0.29), cysteine (0.43), structural (0), aliphatic (0.29), aromatic (0), KB05 (32.48), KB03 (32.23), KB02 (27.68).\n\nDescription: Site O14672 607, located at a depth of 1.82, has a relatively high solvent-accessible surface area (41.27) and a moderate coordination number (27), suggesting a somewhat exposed position with several interactions. Its low RSA (0.23) indicates limited exposure to solvent, while its hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, etc.) suggest weaker hydrogen bonding interactions. The dihedral angles (phi, psi, alpha) indicate a specific conformation, and the absence of a structural motif suggests a lack of defined secondary structure.  The amino acid composition shows a relatively high proportion of cysteine (0.43) and aliphatic residues (0.29). KB05, KB03, and KB02 values suggest specific properties that are difficult to interpret without more context.\n\nSummary: This site appears to be a relatively exposed residue with a unique amino acid composition, possibly involved in weak interactions, and lacking defined secondary structure.\n\n\n**Row 2 (site: O14672 435):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14672 435), depth (2.02), absolute_sasa (32.31), hse_up (15), hse_down (14), coord_number (29), rsa (0.20), h_nho1 (-0.2), h_ohn1 (-1.5), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (0.92), kappa (110.9), alpha (44.8), phi (-63.7), psi (-43.3), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.2), acidic (0), polar (0.4), cysteine (0.2), structural (0), aliphatic (0.2), aromatic (0), KB05 (43.25), KB03 (49.06), KB02 (42.41).\n\nDescription: Site O14672 435, at a depth of 2.02, exhibits a smaller solvent-accessible surface area (32.31) compared to the previous site but a higher coordination number (29), implying a more buried position with numerous interactions.  Its hydrogen bonding suggests some stronger interactions (h_ohn1 = -1.5), and the positive TCO (0.92) might indicate involvement in a turn or loop.  The presence of an alpha-helix (struct_motif: H) is confirmed by the dihedral angles. The amino acid composition shows a balanced distribution of polar and basic residues. KB05, KB03, and KB02 values are higher than in the previous site.\n\nSummary: This site is a more buried residue within an alpha-helix, exhibiting stronger hydrogen bonding and a distinct amino acid composition compared to the first site.\n\n\n**Row 3 (site: O14646 421):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14646 421), depth (2.23), absolute_sasa (16.07), hse_up (12), hse_down (17), coord_number (29), rsa (0.08), h_nho1 (-2), h_ohn1 (-0.3), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-0.2), tco (-0.28), kappa (41.2), alpha (-165.8), phi (-59.3), psi (157.3), struct_motif (N/A), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0.17), acidic (0.17), polar (0.33), cysteine (0.17), structural (0), aliphatic (0), aromatic (0.17). KB05 (29.41), KB03 (39.66), KB02 (23.06).\n\nDescription: Site O14646 421, at a depth of 2.23, has a small solvent-accessible surface area (16.07) and a high coordination number (29), indicating a buried location with many interactions.  The very low RSA (0.08) confirms its buried nature. The low hydrogen bond score (h_nho1 = -2) indicates a potential strong hydrogen bond interaction. The dihedral angles suggest a specific conformation. This site is characterized by a relatively even distribution of basic, acidic, polar, and cysteine residues.  It lacks defined secondary structure (struct_motif: N/A) and has a proportion of aromatic residues.\n\nSummary: This buried site displays strong hydrogen bond interactions and a balanced amino acid composition, lacking defined secondary structure.\n\n\n**Row 4 (site: O14672 632):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14672 632), depth (2.50), absolute_sasa (6.04), hse_up (24), hse_down (13), coord_number (37), rsa (0.05), h_nho1 (-1.3), h_ohn1 (-1.7), h_nho2 (-0.1), h_ohn2 (-1.2), tco (-0.99), kappa (45.6), alpha (29.7), phi (-159), psi (153), struct_motif (E), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0), polar (0.2), cysteine (0.2), structural (0.4), aliphatic (0.2), aromatic (0), KB05 (40.34), KB03 (44.36), KB02 (32.16).\n\nDescription: Site O14672 632, deeply buried at 2.50, has a very small solvent-accessible surface area (6.04) and a high coordination number (37), indicating a highly buried and interactive position.  The extremely low RSA (0.05) confirms this.  The low hydrogen bond scores (h_nho1, h_ohn1, h_ohn2) indicate strong hydrogen bonding interactions.  The presence of an extended strand (struct_motif: E) is evidenced by the dihedral angles. The amino acid composition shows a significant proportion of structural residues (0.4).\n\nSummary: This deeply buried site is highly interactive and part of an extended strand, characterized by strong hydrogen bonding and a high proportion of structural residues.\n\n\n**Row 5 (site: O14646 436):**\n\nColumn names and values: site (O14646 436), depth (1.95), absolute_sasa (25.20), hse_up (18), hse_down (8), coord_number (26), rsa (0.13), h_nho1 (-0.7), h_ohn1 (-2.2), h_nho2 (-0.2), h_ohn2 (-0.4), tco (0.86), kappa (109.2), alpha (50.4), phi (-64.7), psi (-39.1), struct_motif (H), pocket (0), interface (FALSE), basic (0), acidic (0.25), polar (0), cysteine (0), structural (0), aliphatic (0.75), aromatic (0), KB05 (33.84), KB03 (35.61), KB02 (25.14).\n\nDescription: Site O14646 436, at a depth of 1.95, shows a moderate solvent-accessible surface area (25.20) and a moderate coordination number (26).  The RSA (0.13) indicates partial exposure.  Hydrogen bonding appears stronger (h_ohn1 = -2.2). The presence of an alpha-helix (struct_motif: H) is confirmed by the dihedral angles, and the positive TCO (0.86) supports this. The amino acid composition is dominated by aliphatic residues (0.75) and shows a proportion of acidic residues.\n\nSummary: This site is partially exposed, part of an alpha-helix, and shows a strong hydrogen bond interaction and is dominated by aliphatic residues.\n"
