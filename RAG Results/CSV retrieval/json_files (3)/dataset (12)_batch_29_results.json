        "response": "The provided data is not in CSV format; it's a series of rows with three columns: \"protein,\" \"label,\" and \"stage.\"  Each row represents a protein sequence (\"protein\" column), its associated numerical label (\"label\" column), and the stage of the process it belongs to (\"stage\" column, which is consistently \"test\" in all rows).  The protein sequences are very similar, differing only by a few amino acids. The label values vary, suggesting that these small variations significantly impact the label's numerical value.  There is no clear pattern in the relationship between the amino acid differences and the changes in label value apparent from this small sample.\n"
