Note that the data is presented as text, not a CSV, so the analysis is based on the text formatting.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7Y:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the L7Y mutation, resulting in the amino acid sequence KELVLAYYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, exhibits a log10 K50 for trypsin of 0.18 and for chymotrypsin of -1.34, translating to a dG of 1.47 kcal/mol and a ddG of -2.61 kcal/mol, classifying this mutation as destabilizing.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_Y8Q:**  The 1QKX.pdb protein with the Y8Q mutation (amino acid sequence: KELVLALQDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL) shows log10 K50 values of 1.93 for trypsin and 0.86 for chymotrypsin, leading to a dG of 4.13 kcal/mol and a ddG of 0.04 kcal/mol, indicating a neutral effect on protein stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7W:**  The L7W mutation in 1QKX.pdb (amino acid sequence: KELVLAWYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL) displays log10 K50 values of 0.03 for trypsin and -1.33 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a dG of 1.39 kcal/mol and a ddG of -2.70 kcal/mol,  classifying this mutation as destabilizing.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7F:** The 1QKX.pdb protein with the L7F mutation (amino acid sequence: KELVLAFYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL) has log10 K50 values of -0.02 for trypsin and -1.38 for chymotrypsin, yielding a dG of 1.28 kcal/mol and a ddG of -2.80 kcal/mol, indicating a destabilizing effect.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7C:** The 1QKX.pdb protein with the L7C mutation (amino acid sequence: KELVLACYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL) shows log10 K50 values of 1.05 for trypsin and 0.06 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a dG of 3.12 kcal/mol and a ddG of -0.97 kcal/mol, classifying this mutation as destabilizing.\n\n\n**Summary of Observations:** All mutations at position 7 of the 1QKX.pdb protein (except Y8Q) are classified as destabilizing,  demonstrating that alterations at this residue significantly impact protein stability.  The magnitude of destabilization varies across the different mutations.  The Y8Q mutation, however, appears to have a negligible effect on stability.\n"
