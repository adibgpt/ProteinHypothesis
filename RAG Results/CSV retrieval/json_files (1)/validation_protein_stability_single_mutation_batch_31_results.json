        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9Y:**  The mutation D9Y, found in the protein sequence KELVLALYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL (with full sequence SAGGSAGGKELVLALYYYYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKLSAGGSAGG) originating from 1QKX.pdb (WT cluster 15), shows a log10 K50 for trypsin of -0.005 and for chymotrypsin of -1.308, resulting in a calculated dG of 1.520.  The 95% confidence intervals for these values indicate a degree of uncertainty.  This mutation is classified as destabilizing with a ddG of -2.566, suggesting it negatively impacts protein stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9W:** The D9W mutation in the protein sequence KELVLALYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL (full sequence: SAGGSAGGKELVLALYWYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKLSAGGSAGG), derived from 1QKX.pdb (WT cluster 15), exhibits log10 K50 values of -0.080 for trypsin and -1.486 for chymotrypsin, yielding a dG of 1.408.  The relatively narrow 95% confidence intervals suggest higher precision compared to some other mutations.  Similar to D9Y, this mutation is also classified as destabilizing (ddG of -2.678), indicating a reduction in protein stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9F:** In the protein sequence KELVLALYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL (full sequence: SAGGSAGGKELVLALYFYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKLSAGGSAGG) from 1QKX.pdb (WT cluster 15), the D9F mutation displays a positive log10 K50 for trypsin (0.087) and a negative value for chymotrypsin (-1.459), leading to a dG of 1.508.  The wider 95% confidence intervals suggest greater uncertainty in the measurements.  Despite a positive log10 K50 for trypsin, the mutation is still classified as destabilizing (ddG of -2.578), implying a net decrease in stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9I:** For the D9I mutation in the protein sequence KELVLALYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL (full sequence: SAGGSAGGKELVLALYIYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKLSAGGSAGG) from 1QKX.pdb (WT cluster 15), the log10 K50 values are -0.489 for trypsin and -1.806 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a dG of 0.836. The 95% confidence intervals show moderate uncertainty.  This mutation is classified as destabilizing (ddG of -3.250), indicating a significant reduction in protein stability compared to the others.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9P:**  The D9P mutation within the protein sequence KELVLALYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL (full sequence: SAGGSAGGKELVLALYPYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKLSAGGSAGG) from 1QKX.pdb (WT cluster 15) shows a markedly different profile with a positive log10 K50 for trypsin (0.592) and a negative value for chymotrypsin (-0.632), giving a dG of 2.262. The relatively narrow 95% confidence intervals suggest more precise measurements.  Despite the high dG value, it's classified as destabilizing (ddG of -1.824), indicating a substantial destabilization compared to the wild type.\n\n\n**Summary:** All five mutations (D9Y, D9W, D9F, D9I, D9P) at position 9 of the protein from 1QKX.pdb are classified as destabilizing.  While the magnitude of destabilization (ddG) varies, the consistent classification suggests that this position is sensitive to changes in amino acid side chain.  The log10 K50 values for trypsin and chymotrypsin show varied responses to each mutation, highlighting the complexity of protein stability and the influence of specific amino acid substitutions.\n"
