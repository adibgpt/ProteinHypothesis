        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that due to the limited context and the absence of a true CSV structure (the data is presented as key-value pairs), the \"seamless sentence structure\" may be somewhat fragmented.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7K:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the L7K mutation, possessing the DNA sequence `TCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGCAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGAAATACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTGAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGCGGCTCCGCTGGTGGT`, shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 0.475, a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -0.968, a dG of 1.992, and a ddG of -2.094, resulting in a destabilising mutation within WT cluster 15.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7S:**  Protein 1QKX.pdb with the L7S mutation and DNA sequence `TCCGCTGGTGGTTCCGCGGGTGGCAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGTCTTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCTGGCGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT`, exhibits log10 K50 (trypsin) and (chymotrypsin) values of -0.438 and -1.639 respectively, a dG of 0.654, and a ddG of -3.432, also classifying as a destabilising mutation in WT cluster 15.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7D:** The L7D mutation in protein 1QKX.pdb, with DNA sequence `TCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCTGGCGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCTGACTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACTCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTGCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCCGCGGGTGGTTCTGCTGGTGGT`, displays log10 K50 (trypsin) and (chymotrypsin) values of -0.724 and -2.146, a dG of -0.712, and a ddG of -4.798, indicating a significant destabilising effect within WT cluster 15. Note that the deltaG_c_95CI_low value is -25.0, which is an outlier and may indicate an error in the data.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7R:**  For protein 1QKX.pdb with the L7R mutation and DNA sequence `TCCGCTGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGTAAAGAACTCGTTCTGGCGCGTTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTATGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCTGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGT`, the log10 K50 (trypsin) is 0.403, the log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) is -0.980, the dG is 1.989, and the ddG is -2.097, resulting in a classification of destabilising mutation within WT cluster 15.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7T:** Finally, the 1QKX.pdb protein with the L7T mutation and DNA sequence `TCCGCTGGTGGCTCCGCGGGTGGCAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGACCTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTATGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCTGGCGGCTCTGCGGGCGGT` shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 0.396, a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -1.036, a dG of 1.821, and a ddG of -2.265, leading to its classification as a destabilising mutation in WT cluster 15.\n\n\n**Summary of Findings:** All five mutations (L7K, L7S, L7D, L7R, L7T) at position 7 of the 1QKX.pdb protein are classified as destabilising.  There's a wide range of destabilization effects observed, with ddG values ranging from approximately -2 to -5.  Further investigation into the outlier (-25.0) in the L7D mutation data is recommended.\n"
