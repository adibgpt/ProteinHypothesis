        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, formatted as requested.  Note that \"Stabilizing_mut\" has a \"-\" in one case, which I've interpreted as missing data.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_Q11A:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the Q11A mutation, exhibiting a trypsin K50 of 10^1.70 and chymotrypsin K50 of 10^0.72, shows a calculated \u0394G of 4.01 kcal/mol, suggesting a neutral effect on stability compared to the wild type.  The 95% confidence intervals for both K50 and \u0394G indicate moderate uncertainty in the measurements. The mutation is classified as neutral.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_Q11S:**  Protein 1QKX.pdb with the Q11S mutation shows a trypsin K50 of 10^1.61 and chymotrypsin K50 of 10^0.55, resulting in a calculated \u0394G of 3.82 kcal/mol, indicating a slightly destabilizing effect compared to the wild type.  The relatively narrow confidence intervals suggest more precise measurements than in the Q11A mutant.  This mutation is also classified as neutral.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_Q11M:** The Q11M mutation in protein 1QKX.pdb exhibits trypsin and chymotrypsin K50 values of 10^1.80 and 10^0.70 respectively, and a calculated \u0394G of 4.05 kcal/mol, suggesting a nearly neutral effect on stability.  The small confidence intervals suggest high precision in the measurements.  The stabilizing nature of the mutation is unclear due to missing data. The mutation is classified as neutral.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_Q11G:**  In protein 1QKX.pdb, the Q11G mutation shows a significantly lower trypsin K50 of 10^1.07 and a negative chymotrypsin K50 of 10^-0.43, leading to a calculated \u0394G of 2.69 kcal/mol, indicating a substantial destabilization compared to the wild type.  The confidence intervals suggest reasonable precision.  This mutation is classified as destabilizing.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_Q11T:** The Q11T mutation in 1QKX.pdb shows high trypsin and chymotrypsin K50 values of 10^2.07 and 10^0.88 respectively, and a calculated \u0394G of 4.34 kcal/mol, indicating a significant stabilization compared to the wild type.  The confidence intervals are relatively wide.  The stabilizing nature of the mutation is indicated, but not explicitly stated in the data.  The mutation is classified as neutral.\n"
