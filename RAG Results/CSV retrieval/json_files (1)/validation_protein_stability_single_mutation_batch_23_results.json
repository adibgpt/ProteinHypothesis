        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that \"destabilizing\" in the classification column is consistently used despite some mutations showing increased dG values.  This apparent contradiction requires further investigation into the methodology used to determine stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7G:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the L7G mutation, encoded by the DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGCTCCGCTGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTGCTGGCTGGTTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCTGCTTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCGGGCGGTTCTGCTGGCGGT, shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of -0.58 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -1.92, resulting in a calculated dG of 0.30,  classified as destabilizing despite a positive dG value, with a fitting error of 0.07 and 0.03 for trypsin and chymotrypsin respectively.  This suggests a less stable protein compared to the wild type.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7V:**  Protein 1QKX.pdb with the L7V mutation, with DNA sequence TCTGCTGGCGGTTCTGCGGGCGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCTGTTTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCTTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCCGCTGGTGGCTCCGCGGGTGGT, exhibits a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 0.86 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -0.46, yielding a dG of 2.56, classified as destabilizing,  with fitting errors of 0.10 and 0.08 respectively. The positive dG value is counterintuitive to its classification.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7A:** The L7A mutation in 1QKX.pdb, encoded by TCCGCTGGCGGCTCTGCGGGCGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCTGCGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGTGGTTCCGCGGGTGGT, shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of -0.08 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -1.27, resulting in a dG of 1.45, and classified as destabilizing, with fitting errors of 0.08 and 0.09 respectively.  Again, the positive dG is at odds with the classification.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7I:**  Protein 1QKX.pdb with the L7I mutation and DNA sequence TCTGCGGGTGGTTCCGCTGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTGCTGGCTATCTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAGGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTATGTGAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGCGGTTCTGCGGGTGGT displays a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 1.40 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of 0.24, resulting in a dG of 3.29, classified as destabilizing, with fitting errors of 0.15 and 0.09 respectively. The high dG value contradicts the destabilizing classification.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7M:**  The 1QKX.pdb protein with the L7M mutation, encoded by TCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGATGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCTTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCCGCTGGTGGCTCTGCTGGCGGT, shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 1.35 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of 0.05, yielding a dG of 3.24, and classified as destabilizing, with fitting errors of 0.06 and 0.05 respectively.  The positive dG value is inconsistent with the classification.\n"
