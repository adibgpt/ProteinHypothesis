        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, formatted as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** protein_name: APOA2_MACMU; species: Macaca mulatta; sequence: QAEEPSVESLVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAQAKAYFEKSKEQLTPLVKKAGTDLVNFLSYFVELRTQPATQ; annotation: Apo A-II makes up about 20% of the protein of the HDL (high density lipoprotein) phospholipid-rich fraction in plasma; Subcellular locations: Secreted Plasma.\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:**  The *Macaca mulatta* protein APOA2_MACMU, with sequence QAEEPSVESLVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAQAKAYFEKSKEQLTPLVKKAGTDLVNFLSYFVELRTQPATQ, is a secreted plasma protein annotated as Apo A-II, constituting approximately 20% of the HDL phospholipid-rich fraction.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row describes a specific Apo A-II protein from rhesus macaques, highlighting its significant contribution to the HDL structure and its presence in the plasma.\n\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** protein_name: APOA2_NASLA; species: Nasalis larvatus; sequence: MKLLAATVLLLTICSLEGALVRRQAEEPSVESLVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAQAKAYFEKSKEQLTPLVKKAGTDLVNFLSYFVELRTQPATQ; annotation: May stabilize HDL (high density lipoprotein) structure by its association with lipids, and affect the HDL metabolism; Subcellular locations: Secreted\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** The *Nasalis larvatus* protein APOA2_NASLA, possessing the sequence MKLLAATVLLLTICSLEGALVRRQAEEPSVESLVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAQAKAYFEKSKEQLTPLVKKAGTDLVNFLSYFVELRTQPATQ, is a secreted protein that potentially stabilizes HDL structure through lipid interactions and influences HDL metabolism.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row details a potentially functionally similar Apo A-II protein from proboscis monkeys, suggesting a conserved role in HDL metabolism across primate species, but with a less precise quantification compared to the rhesus macaque protein.\n\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** protein_name: APOA2_PONAB; species: Pongo abelii; sequence: MKLLAATVLLLTICSLEGALVRRQAKEPCVESPVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAEAKSYFEKSKEQLTPLIKKAGTELVNFLNYFLEL; annotation: May stabilize HDL (high density lipoprotein) structure by its association with lipids, and affect the HDL metabolism; Subcellular locations: Secreted\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:**  The *Pongo abelii* protein APOA2_PONAB, with the sequence MKLLAATVLLLTICSLEGALVRRQAKEPCVESPVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAEAKSYFEKSKEQLTPLIKKAGTELVNFLNYFLEL, is a secreted protein that may contribute to HDL structure stabilization and influence its metabolism.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row presents an Apo A-II protein from a Bornean orangutan with a slightly different sequence and annotation, suggesting potential variations in function compared to other primates.  The sequence is also shorter than others.\n\n\n**Row 4:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** protein_name: APOA2_PANPA; species: Pan paniscus; sequence: MKLLAATVLLLTICSLEGALVRRQAKEPCVDNLVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAEAKSYFEKSKEQLTPLIKKAGTELVNFLSYFMELGTQPATQ; annotation: May stabilize HDL (high density lipoprotein) structure by its association with lipids, and affect the HDL metabolism; Subcellular locations: Secreted Plasma.\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** The *Pan paniscus* protein APOA2_PANPA, having the sequence MKLLAATVLLLTICSLEGALVRRQAKEPCVDNLVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAEAKSYFEKSKEQLTPLIKKAGTELVNFLSYFMELGTQPATQ, is a secreted plasma protein potentially involved in HDL structure stabilization and metabolism.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row describes a bonobo Apo A-II protein with a suggested role in HDL metabolism and a presence in the plasma, similar to the rhesus macaque protein.\n\n\n**Row 5:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** protein_name: APOA2_PANTR; species: Pan troglodytes; sequence: MKLLAATVLLLTICSLEGALVRRQAKEPCVDNLVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAEAKSYFEKSKEQLTPLIKKAGTELVNFLSYFMELGTQPATQ; annotation: May stabilize HDL (high density lipoprotein) structure by its association with lipids, and affect the HDL metabolism; Subcellular locations: Secreted Plasma.\n\n2. **Descriptive Sentence:** The *Pan troglodytes* protein APOA2_PANTR, with the sequence MKLLAATVLLLTICSLEGALVRRQAKEPCVDNLVSQYFQTVTDYGKDLMEKVKSPELQAEAKSYFEKSKEQLTPLIKKAGTELVNFLSYFMELGTQPATQ, is a secreted plasma protein that likely influences HDL structure and metabolism.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row details a chimpanzee Apo A-II protein, showing high sequence similarity to the bonobo protein (Row 4) and suggesting a conserved function in HDL metabolism within this genus.  It's also found in the plasma.\n"
