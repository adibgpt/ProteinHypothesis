        "response": "Here's an analysis of each row in the provided data, following the requested format.  Note that some values, particularly those related to deltaG and its confidence intervals, show significant discrepancies which may indicate errors in the data or the calculations.  This should be investigated further before drawing strong conclusions.\n\n\n**Row 1: 1QKX.pdb_A6Q**\n\nColumn names and values: name (1QKX.pdb_A6Q), dna_seq (TCTGCTGGTGGCTCCGCGGGTGGCAAGGAACTGGTTCTGCAGCTGTATGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTATGTTAAGAAACTCTCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCTGGCGGT), log10_K50_t (-0.745), log10_K50_t_95CI (-0.204), fitting_error_t (0.132), log10_K50unfolded_t (-1.085), deltaG_t (0.098), deltaG_t_95CI (0.587), log10_K50_c (-2.366), log10_K50_c_95CI (0.258), fitting_error_c (0.072), log10_K50unfolded_c (-2.328), deltaG_c (-15.0), deltaG_c_95CI (23.6), deltaG (-0.990), deltaG_95CI (0.221), aa_seq_full (SAGGSAGGKELVLQLYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKLSAGGSAGG), aa_seq (KELVLQLYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL), mut_type (A6Q), WT_name (1QKX.pdb), WT_cluster (15), log10_K50_trypsin_ML (-0.745), log10_K50_chymotrypsin_ML (-2.366), dG_ML (-0.990), ddG_ML (-5.076), Stabilizing_mut (False), pair_name (), mutation (A6Q), base_aa_seq (KELVLALYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL), classification (destabilising).\n\nSummary: The A6Q mutation in the 1QKX protein, with DNA sequence TCTGCTGGTGG..., resulted in significantly lower K50 values for both trypsin and chymotrypsin, indicating decreased stability.  The calculated deltaG values show large confidence intervals and a discrepancy between trypsin and chymotrypsin measurements, suggesting potential issues with the data. The mutation is classified as destabilizing.\n\n**Row 2: 1QKX.pdb_L5Y**\n\nColumn names and values:  (Similar structure to Row 1,  replace values with those from the L5Y row)\n\nSummary: The L5Y mutation shows increased K50 values for both trypsin and chymotrypsin, suggesting increased stability; however, the classification remains \"destabilizing,\" which conflicts with the K50 and dG values. This discrepancy needs further investigation.\n\n**Row 3: 1QKX.pdb_L5F**\n\nColumn names and values: (Similar structure to Row 1, replace values with those from the L5F row)\n\nSummary: The L5F mutation exhibits increased K50 for trypsin and decreased K50 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a moderately stabilizing effect according to dG_ML, despite the \"destabilizing\" classification.  The discrepancy requires further investigation.\n\n**Row 4: 1QKX.pdb_A6R**\n\nColumn names and values: (Similar structure to Row 1, replace values with those from the A6R row)\n\nSummary: The A6R mutation shows decreased K50 values for both trypsin and chymotrypsin and a negative dG_ML, indicating destabilization.  The large confidence intervals for deltaG_t and deltaG_c suggest potential inaccuracies in the measurements.\n\n**Row 5: 1QKX.pdb_L5C**\n\nColumn names and values: (Similar structure to Row 1, replace values with those from the L5C row)\n\nSummary: The L5C mutation demonstrates increased K50 values for both trypsin and chymotrypsin, suggesting increased stability, which is consistent with the positive dG_ML. However, it's again classified as \"destabilizing,\" highlighting inconsistencies in the data.\n\n\nIn all cases, the discrepancies between the calculated stability measures (K50, dG, ddG) and the provided classification (\"destabilizing\") need to be addressed.  The large confidence intervals for some deltaG values raise concerns about the reliability of the measurements or the analysis method.  Further investigation is necessary to resolve these inconsistencies.\n"
