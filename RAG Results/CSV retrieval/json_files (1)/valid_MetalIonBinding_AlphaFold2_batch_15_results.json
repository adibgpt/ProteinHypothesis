I will treat each block of data as a row in a hypothetical CSV.\n\n**Row 1:**  The protein 7jj8_D-Q8CWN2, with amino acid sequence GKLNIVTTFYPVYEFTKQVAGDTANVELLIGAGTEPHEYEPSAKAVAKIQDADTFVYENENMETWVPKLLDTLDKKKVKTIKATGDMLLLPGGEEEEGDHDHGEEGHHHEFDPHVWLSPVRAIKLVEHIRDSLSADYPDKKETFEKNAAAYIEKLQSLDKAYAEGLSQAKQKSFVTQHAAFNYLALDYGLKQVAISGLSPDAEPSAARLAELTEYVKKNKIAYIYFEENASQALANTLSKEAGVKTDVLNPLESLTEEDTKAGENYISVMEKNLKALKQTTDQEGPAIEPEKAEDTKTV, exhibits a predicted secondary structure (Foldseek, SS8, SS3) suggesting a mix of alpha helices and beta sheets, and its structural representation (esm3_structure_seq) shows a specific numerical pattern.  This protein is labeled as 1, indicating a positive classification for an unknown characteristic.\n\n\n**Row 2:** Protein 2kqe_A-Q8IW19, possessing the amino acid sequence GSEGNKVKRTSCMYGANCYRKNPVHFQHFSHPGDSDYGGVQIVGQDETDDRPECPYGPSCYRKNPQHKIEYRHNTLPVRNVLDE, shows a predicted structure (Foldseek, SS8, SS3) primarily composed of loops and some helices, and the esm3_structure_seq provides a distinct numerical sequence. This protein, similarly to the first, is labeled 1, suggesting a similar classification.\n\n\n**Row 3:** The protein 3cb7_B-Q7YT17, characterized by the amino acid sequence KTFTRCSLAREMYKLGVPKNQLARWTCIAEHESSYNTKAVGSLNSNGSRDYGIFQINNYYWCSPPSGAFSYDECKIKCEDFLVDSIEPAVKCAQLVLKQQGWTAWSTWKYCDGTLPSIDDCF, presents a predicted secondary structure (Foldseek, SS8, SS3) with a combination of helices and beta sheets; its esm3_structure_seq contains a unique numerical sequence. This protein is labeled 0, suggesting a different classification than the previous two.\n\n\n**Row 4:** Protein 3zka_B-P0A4G2, with amino acid sequence KLKVVATNSIIADITKNIAGDKIDLHSIVPIGQDPHEYEPLPEDVKKTSEADLIFYNGINLETGGNAWFTKLVENAKKTENKDYFAVSDGVDVIYLEGQNEKGKEDPHAWLNLENGIIFAKNIAKQLSAKDPNNKEFYEKNLKEYTDKLDKLDKESKDKFNKIPAEKKLIVTSEGAFKYFSKAYGVPSAYIWEINTEEEGTPEQIKTLVEKLRQTKVPSLFVESSVDDRPMKTVSQDTNIPIYAQIFTDSIAEQGKEGDSYYSMMKYNLDKIAEGLAK, has a predicted secondary structure (Foldseek, SS8, SS3) indicating a complex arrangement of helices and sheets, and its esm3_structure_seq shows a numerical pattern distinct from the others. This protein is labeled 1, indicating a positive classification.\n\n\n**Row 5:** Protein 7me3_B-Q56952, having the amino acid sequence MIERLNSPFLRAAALFTIVAFSSLISTAALAENNPSDTAKKFKVVTTFTIIQDIAQNIAGDVAVVESITKPGAEIHDYQPTPRDIVKAQSADLILWNGMNLERWFEKFFESIKDVPSAVVTAGITPLPIREGPYSGIANPHAWMSPSNALIYIENIRKALVEHDPAHAETYNRNAQAYAEKIKALDAPLRERLSRIPAEQRWLVTSEGAFSYLAKDYGFKEVYLWPINAEQQGIPQQVRHVIDIIRENKIPVVFSESTISDKPAKQVSKETGAQYGGVLYVDSLSGEKGPVPTYISLINMTVDTIAKGFGQ, displays a predicted secondary structure (Foldseek, SS8, SS3) with a substantial amount of helices and sheets, and a unique numerical sequence in its esm3_structure_seq.  This protein is labeled 1, suggesting a similar classification to rows 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\n**Summary Statement:** The data suggests a potential correlation between the predicted secondary structure and the label (0 or 1).  Proteins with primarily helical and sheet structures (as indicated by Foldseek, SS8, and SS3 predictions) tend to have a label of 1.  However, more data would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.  The esm3_structure_seq provides a unique numerical representation for each protein, possibly reflecting unique structural features, but its relationship to the label requires further investigation.\n"
