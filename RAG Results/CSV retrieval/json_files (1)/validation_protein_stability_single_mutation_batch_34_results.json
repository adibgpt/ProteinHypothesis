The relatively wide 95% confidence intervals suggest some uncertainty in the measurements.\n\n\n**Row 4: 1QKX.pdb_Q11R**\n\nSummary Sentence: The Q11R mutation in 1QKX protein, classified as neutral, exhibits a significantly lower dG_ML (3.6980) compared to the other mutations, and a negative ddG (-0.3880), clearly indicating destabilization of the protein.\n\n**Row 5: 1QKX.pdb_Q11D**\n\nSummary Sentence: The Q11D mutation in the 1QKX protein is classified as neutral but shows a higher dG_ML (4.1571) and a positive ddG (0.0711), suggesting a slight increase in protein stability compared to the wild type.  The relatively large confidence intervals highlight the uncertainty in the measurements.\n\n\nThis analysis provides a concise summary of each row's features and their interpretations.  Remember that the interpretation is based solely on the provided data and might require additional context for a more comprehensive understanding.\n"
