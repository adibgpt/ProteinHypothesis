        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, formatted as requested.  Note that \"destabilizing\" consistently appears in the classification column, which suggests a limitation in the data or analysis method.  Further investigation may be needed to understand if this is an actual trend or an artifact.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_V4F:** The mutation V4F, in the protein 1QKX.pdb from cluster 15, shows a log10 K50 for trypsin of 0.46 and for chymotrypsin of -0.90, resulting in a calculated dG of 2.00.  This translates to a ddG of -2.09, classifying the mutation as destabilizing.  The relatively low K50 values and negative ddG suggest the mutation reduces protein stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_V4W:** The V4W mutation in 1QKX.pdb (cluster 15) exhibits higher log10 K50 values for both trypsin (0.66) and chymotrypsin (-0.66) compared to V4F, leading to a higher dG of 2.33 and a ddG of -1.75. This mutation, like V4F, is classified as destabilizing, indicating reduced protein stability despite the slightly higher dG value.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_V4Y:**  The V4Y mutation in protein 1QKX.pdb (cluster 15) shows the highest log10 K50 values among the presented mutations for both trypsin (0.88) and chymotrypsin (-0.29), resulting in a dG of 2.66 and a ddG of -1.42. Similar to the previous mutations, this is categorized as destabilizing. This suggests a consistent destabilization trend for the V4 mutations.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_V4L:** The V4L mutation in 1QKX.pdb (cluster 15) displays significantly higher log10 K50 values for trypsin (1.49) and chymotrypsin (0.26), leading to a substantially higher dG of 3.50 and a ddG of -0.59. Despite the increased dG, this mutation is also classified as destabilizing, suggesting that the classification criteria may need review.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_V4I:** The V4I mutation in 1QKX.pdb (cluster 15) presents intermediate log10 K50 values for trypsin (0.99) and chymotrypsin (-0.28), leading to a dG of 2.77 and a ddG of -1.32.  This mutation, consistent with the others, is classified as destabilizing.  The data suggests a trend of destabilization regardless of the magnitude of the dG change.\n"
