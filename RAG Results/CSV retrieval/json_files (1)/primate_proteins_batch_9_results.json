Note that the data is presented as text, not a CSV file, so the analysis is based on the text structure.\n\n**Row 1: ACD11_PONAB**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:**\n    * protein_name: ACD11_PONAB\n    * species: Pongo abelii\n    * sequence: MKPGATGESDLAEVLPQHKFDSKSLEAYLNQHLSGFGAEREATLTIAQYRAGKSNPTFYLQKGFQTYVLRKKPPGSLLPKAHQIDREFKVQKALFSIGFPVPKPILYCSDTSVIGTEFYIMEHVQGRIFRDLTIPGVSPAERSALYVAIVETLAQLHSLNIQSLQLEGYGIGAGYCKRQVSTWTKQYQAAAHQDIPAMQQLSEWLMKNLPDNDNEENLIHGDFRLDNIIFHPKECRVIAVLDWELSTIGHPLSDLAHFSLFYFWPRTVPMINQGSYSEENSGIPSMEELISIYCRCRGINSSLPNWNFFLALSYFKMAGIAQGVYSRYLLGNNSSEDSFLFANIVQPLAETGLQLSKRTFSTVLPQIDTAGQLFVQTRKGQEVLIKVKHFMKQHILPAEKEVTEFYVQNENSVDKWGKPLVIDKLKEMAKAEGLWNLFLPAVSGLSQVDYALIAEETGKCFFAPDVFNCQAPDTGNMEILHLYGSEEQKKQWLEPLLQGNITSCFCMTEPDVASSDATNIECSIQREEDSYVINGKKWWSSGAGNPKCKIAIVLGRTQNTSLSRHKQHSMILVPMNTPGVEIIRPLSVFGYTDNFHGGHFEIHFNQVRVPATNLILGEGRGFEISQGRLGPGRIHHCMRTVGLAERALQIMCERATQRIAFKKKLYAHEVVAHWIAESRIAIEKIRLLTLKAAHSMDTLGSAGAKKEIAMIKVAAPRAVSKIVDWAIQVCGGAGVSQDYPLANMYAITRVLRLADGPDEVHLSAIATMELRDQAKRLTAKI\n    * annotation: Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, that exhibits maximal activity towards saturated C22-CoA. Probably participates in beta-oxydation and energy production but could also play a role in the metabolism of specific fatty acids to control fatty acids composition of cellular lipids in brain.\n    * Subcellular locations: Peroxisome, Mitochondrion membrane\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** The protein ACD11_PONAB, found in *Pongo abelii* (orangutan), possesses a specific amino acid sequence and functions as an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase with maximal activity toward saturated C22-CoA, likely involved in beta-oxidation, energy production, and fatty acid metabolism within the brain's cellular lipids; its subcellular locations include the peroxisome and mitochondrial membrane.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row describes an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase from orangutans with a characterized function in fatty acid metabolism and localization to peroxisomes and mitochondria.\n\n\n**Row 2: ACHA_HUMAN**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:**  (Similar structure as above,  values will be extracted from the provided text)\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** The human protein ACHA_HUMAN, with its specific amino acid sequence, is a non-functional acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit not integrated into functional acetylcholine-gated cation-selective channels, located on the postsynaptic and cell membranes; isoform 1 is expressed only in skeletal muscle, while isoform 2 is constitutively expressed in various tissues.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row details a non-functional human acetylcholine receptor isoform with distinct tissue-specific expression patterns.\n\n\n**Row 3: ACADV_HUMAN**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** (Similar structure as above)\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** The human protein ACADV_HUMAN, characterized by its amino acid sequence, acts as a very long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalyzing the initial step of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, specifically targeting acyl-CoAs with saturated 12-24 carbon chains; it is primarily located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, with additional detection in kidney and liver.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row describes a human very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase crucial for mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, exhibiting tissue-specific expression patterns.\n\n\n**Row 4: ACD11_HUMAN**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** (Similar structure as above)\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** The human protein ACD11_HUMAN, with its specific amino acid sequence, functions as an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase exhibiting maximal activity towards saturated C22-CoA, possibly participating in beta-oxidation, energy production, and fatty acid metabolism regulation in the brain; its subcellular location varies across tissues, with mitochondrial membrane association in some and cytoplasmic vesicles in others; it displays widespread expression, with highest levels in the brain.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row describes a human acyl-CoA dehydrogenase with a role in fatty acid metabolism and varying subcellular localization depending on the tissue, showing a high expression level in the brain.\n\n\n**Row 5: ACADV_MACFA**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** (Similar structure as above)\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** The *Macaca fascicularis* (crab-eating macaque) protein ACADV_MACFA, with its amino acid sequence, is a very long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase that catalyzes the first step of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, acting on acyl-CoAs with 12-24 carbon chains; it is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** This row describes a macaque very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n"
