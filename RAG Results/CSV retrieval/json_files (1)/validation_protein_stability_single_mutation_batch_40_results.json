The analysis is therefore based on interpreting the text provided.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E12Y:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the E12Y mutation, possessing the DNA sequence  TCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGTAAAGAACTCGTTCTGGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGTACAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGCGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCTTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGTGGCTCCGCTGGCGGT and amino acid sequence KELVLALYDYQYKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, exhibits log10 K50 values of 0.399 for trypsin and -1.088 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a calculated dG of 1.95 kcal/mol.  This mutation is classified as destabilizing, with a ddG of -2.13 kcal/mol, indicating a decrease in protein stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E12P:** Protein 1QKX.pdb with the E12P mutation, having the DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGTTCCGCTGGTGGCAAAGAACTCGTTCTGGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGCCAAAATCTCCACGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGCGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCTTACGTTAAGAAGCTGTCTGCTGGCGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT and amino acid sequence KELVLALYDYQPKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, shows log10 K50 values of 1.96 for trypsin and 0.83 for chymotrypsin, yielding a dG of 4.35 kcal/mol.  This mutation is classified as neutral, with a small positive ddG of 0.26 kcal/mol, suggesting minimal impact on protein stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E12F:** Protein 1QKX.pdb with the E12F mutation, with DNA sequence TCTGCTGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGCAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCTGTACGACTACCAATTCAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCCGCTGGTGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT and amino acid sequence KELVLALYDYQFKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, displays log10 K50 values of 0.59 for trypsin and -0.83 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a dG of 2.31 kcal/mol. This mutation is classified as destabilizing, with a ddG of -1.78 kcal/mol, showing a significant decrease in protein stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E12W:** Protein 1QKX.pdb with the E12W mutation, possessing the DNA sequence TCTGCGGGTGGTTCCGCTGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGCTGTACGACTACCAATGGAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTCTCTGCTGGCGGTTCTGCGGGTGGT and amino acid sequence KELVLALYDYQWKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, exhibits log10 K50 values of 0.43 for trypsin and -0.92 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a dG of 2.20 kcal/mol.  This mutation is classified as destabilizing, with a ddG of -1.89 kcal/mol, indicating a substantial decrease in protein stability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E12I:** Protein 1QKX.pdb with the E12I mutation, having the DNA sequence TCTGCTGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGCAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGATCAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTCTCCGCTGGTGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT and amino acid sequence KELVLALYDYQIKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, shows log10 K50 values of 0.60 for trypsin and -0.67 for chymotrypsin, yielding a dG of 2.36 kcal/mol. This mutation is classified as destabilizing, with a ddG of -1.72 kcal/mol, suggesting a notable decrease in protein stability.\n\n\nIn summary, all mutations at position 12 (E12X) except E12P are classified as destabilizing,  demonstrating that the introduction of different amino acids at this position generally reduces the stability of the 1QKX protein.  The magnitude of destabilization varies depending on the specific amino acid substitution.\n"
