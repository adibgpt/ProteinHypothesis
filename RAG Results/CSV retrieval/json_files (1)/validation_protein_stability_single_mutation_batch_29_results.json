        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9K:**  The protein 1QKX.pdb with the D9K mutation, characterized by the amino acid sequence KELVLALYKYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL derived from the DNA sequence TCTGCTGGCGGCTCCGCGGGTGGCAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCTGTACAAATACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGCGACATCCTCACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGATTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGCCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCCGCTGGTGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT, exhibits a log10 K50 (trypsin) of -0.29 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -1.51, resulting in a calculated dG of 1.21 kcal/mol; this indicates a destabilization (ddG of -2.87 kcal/mol) compared to the wild type.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9H:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the D9H mutation, possessing the amino acid sequence KELVLALYHYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL originating from the DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGTTCTGCTGGCGGCAAAGAACTCGTTCTGGCGCTGTACCACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCTTACGTTAAAAAGCTCTCCGCTGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGT, shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 0.65 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -0.91, leading to a dG of 2.22 kcal/mol; this suggests destabilization (ddG of -1.87 kcal/mol) relative to the wild type.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9S:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the D9S mutation, with the amino acid sequence KELVLALYSYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL encoded by the DNA sequence TCCGCTGGTGGCTCCGCGGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCTCTACTCTTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCGGGTGGTTCTGCTGGCGGT, presents a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 1.08 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -0.37, yielding a dG of 3.16 kcal/mol;  this also indicates destabilization (ddG of -0.93 kcal/mol) when compared to the wild type.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9T:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the D9T mutation, having the amino acid sequence KELVLALYTYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL from the DNA sequence TCTGCTGGCGGCTCCGCGGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGCTGTACACCTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAGGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCTTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCGGGTGGTTCCGCTGGTGGT, displays a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 0.54 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -0.83, resulting in a dG of 2.28 kcal/mol; this shows destabilization (ddG of -1.81 kcal/mol) in relation to the wild type.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9R:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the D9R mutation, containing the amino acid sequence KELVLALYRYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL translated from the DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGCTCTGCTGGTGGCAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGCTGTACCGTTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGCGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCTTATGTTAAGAAACTCTCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCTGGCGGT, has a log10 K50 (trypsin) of -0.22 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of -1.67, giving a dG of 1.29 kcal/mol; this suggests destabilization (ddG of -2.79 kcal/mol) in comparison to the wild type.\n\n\n**Summary:** All five mutations (D9K, D9H, D9S, D9T, D9R) at position 9 of the 1QKX.pdb protein are classified as destabilizing,  demonstrating a negative ddG value in each case.  The degree of destabilization varies across the mutations, ranging from approximately -0.93 to -2.87 kcal/mol.  Further investigation is needed to understand the structural basis for these destabilizations.\n"
