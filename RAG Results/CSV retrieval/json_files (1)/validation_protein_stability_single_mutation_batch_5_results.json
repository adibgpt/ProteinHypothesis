        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E2D:**  The protein 1QKX.pdb with the E2D mutation, exhibiting a DNA sequence TCCGCTGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGCAAAGACCTGGTTCTGGCGCTCTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCTGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGT, shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 1.71 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of 0.48, resulting in a calculated deltaG of 3.79.  The 95% confidence intervals for these values indicate a relatively low degree of uncertainty. The mutation is classified as neutral, showing no significant change in stability (ddG_ML = -0.295).\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E2N:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the E2N mutation,  represented by the DNA sequence TCCGCTGGCGGCTCCGCGGGTGGTAAAAACCTCGTTCTGGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGT, displays a higher log10 K50 (trypsin) of 1.93 compared to the E2D mutant, and a slightly higher log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) value of 0.48, leading to a deltaG of 4.07.  The larger confidence intervals suggest more uncertainty in these measurements.  This mutation is also classified as neutral, with a minor change in stability (ddG_ML = -0.019).\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E2R:** The E2R mutation in protein 1QKX.pdb, with DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGCTCCGCTGGTGGTAAACGTCTGGTTCTCGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGCGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAGAAGCTGTCTGCTGGCGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT, shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 1.54 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of 0.42, resulting in a calculated deltaG of 3.85. The smaller confidence intervals suggest less uncertainty than the E2N mutation. This neutral mutation shows a modest decrease in stability compared to the wild type (ddG_ML = -0.241).\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E2H:**  The 1QKX.pdb protein with the E2H mutation and DNA sequence TCCGCTGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGTAAACACCTGGTTCTCGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCTTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGT, has a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 1.51 and a log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of 0.46, resulting in a deltaG of 3.76.  The confidence intervals suggest moderate uncertainty in the measurements.  This is another neutral mutation with a decrease in stability (ddG_ML = -0.328).\n\n**1QKX.pdb_E2Q:**  Protein 1QKX.pdb with the E2Q mutation and DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGTAAACAGCTGGTGCTGGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCTGGTGGTTCCGCTGGCGGC, shows a log10 K50 (trypsin) of 1.63 and a markedly higher log10 K50 (chymotrypsin) of 0.84 than the other mutants, resulting in a deltaG of 4.15.  The confidence intervals are of moderate size.  This mutation is classified as neutral, showing a slight increase in stability (ddG_ML = 0.064).\n\n\n**Summary of Observations:** All mutations at position 2 (E2X) are classified as neutral based on the provided data. While the trypsin log10 K50 values vary, the chymotrypsin log10 K50 values show more consistency, except for the E2Q mutant. The deltaG values show moderate variation across the mutants, suggesting that while the mutations do affect the protein's stability, the impact is not significant enough to shift its classification from neutral.  Further investigation may be needed to fully characterize the subtle effects of these mutations.\n"
