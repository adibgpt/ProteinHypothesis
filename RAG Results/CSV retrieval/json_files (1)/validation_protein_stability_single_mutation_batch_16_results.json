        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L5A:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the L5A mutation, exhibiting a destabilising effect, shows a log10 K50 for trypsin of 0.57 and for chymotrypsin of -0.86, resulting in a calculated dG of 2.12.  The 95% confidence intervals for these values indicate a degree of uncertainty in the measurements. This mutation is classified as destabilising based on the calculated ddG of -1.97.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L5K:**  Protein 1QKX.pdb with the L5K mutation, also classified as destabilising, displays a significantly higher log10 K50 for trypsin (1.07) compared to chymotrypsin (-0.24), leading to a dG of 2.81. Despite the higher K50 for trypsin, the ddG of -1.27 still indicates destabilization compared to the wild type.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L5S:** The L5S mutation in protein 1QKX.pdb is another destabilising mutation, showing a log10 K50 for trypsin of 0.16 and a much lower value for chymotrypsin (-1.25), resulting in a dG of 1.62. The large negative ddG value of -2.46 strongly supports the destabilising classification of this mutation.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L5T:**  In 1QKX.pdb, the L5T mutation, also destabilising, exhibits a log10 K50 for trypsin of 0.83 and for chymotrypsin of -0.44, giving a dG of 2.61.  The relatively high trypsin K50 value is counteracted by the negative ddG of -1.47, confirming the destabilising nature of the mutation.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L5R:** The L5R mutation in protein 1QKX.pdb is destabilising, with a log10 K50 for trypsin of 1.14 and a log10 K50 for chymotrypsin of -0.11, resulting in a dG of 3.13. Although showing the highest trypsin K50 among the mutations presented,  the ddG of -0.96 still classifies it as destabilising.\n\n\n**Summary of all mutations:** All five mutations (L5A, L5K, L5S, L5T, L5R) at position 5 of the 1QKX.pdb protein are classified as destabilising. While some show relatively high log10 K50 values for trypsin, the ddG calculations consistently indicate a decrease in protein stability compared to the wild type.  The differences in log10 K50 values between trypsin and chymotrypsin suggest varying sensitivities of the two enzymes to the introduced mutations.\n"
