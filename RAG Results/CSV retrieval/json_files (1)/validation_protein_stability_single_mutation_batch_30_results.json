Note that \"destabilizing\" is consistently reported as the classification, which might indicate a bias in the data or the methodology used.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9V:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the D9V mutation,  has a DNA sequence of TCTGCGGGCGGTTCTGCTGGCGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGCTGTACGTTTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTATGTTAAGAAACTGTCCGCTGGTGGTTCCGCGGGTGGT, resulting in an amino acid sequence of KELVLALYVYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, showing a log10 K50 for trypsin of -0.48 and for chymotrypsin of -1.95, leading to a calculated dG of 0.61 and a ddG of -3.48; this mutation is classified as destabilizing.\n\n**Summary:** The D9V mutation in 1QKX.pdb demonstrates significantly decreased stability compared to the wild type, as indicated by the negative ddG value.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9A:** Protein 1QKX.pdb with the D9A mutation displays a DNA sequence of TCCGCGGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCTGTACGCTTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTATGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGCGGCTCCGCTGGTGGT, translating to the amino acid sequence KELVLALYAYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, with log10 K50 values of 0.72 for trypsin and -0.48 for chymotrypsin, yielding a dG of 2.64 and a ddG of -1.44; this mutation is also classified as destabilizing.\n\n**Summary:**  The D9A mutation, while less destabilizing than D9V, still shows a decrease in stability compared to the wild type, as evidenced by the negative ddG.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9L:**  The D9L mutation in 1QKX.pdb, represented by the DNA sequence TCTGCTGGCGGCTCTGCGGGCGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGCTGTATCTGTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTATGTTAAAAAGCTGTCCGCTGGTGGTTCCGCGGGTGGT and amino acid sequence KELVLALYLYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, exhibits log10 K50 values of -0.65 for trypsin and -1.77 for chymotrypsin, leading to a dG of 0.77 and a ddG of -3.31; this mutation is classified as destabilizing.\n\n**Summary:** Similar to D9V, the D9L mutation results in a substantial destabilization of the 1QKX.pdb protein.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9G:**  Protein 1QKX.pdb with the D9G mutation has a DNA sequence of TCCGCGGGTGGCTCCGCTGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGCTCTACGGTTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGCGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCTTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCTGGCGGCTCTGCGGGCGGT, resulting in the amino acid sequence KELVLALYGYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL; it shows a log10 K50 of 0.35 for trypsin and -0.78 for chymotrypsin, giving a dG of 2.05 and a ddG of -2.04; this mutation is classified as destabilizing.\n\n**Summary:** The D9G mutation shows a considerable decrease in protein stability compared to the wild type, although less pronounced than D9V and D9L.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_D9M:**  The 1QKX.pdb protein with the D9M mutation, characterized by the DNA sequence TCTGCTGGTGGCTCCGCTGGCGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCTGTATATGTATCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTATGTTAAGAAACTGTCCGCGGGTGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT and amino acid sequence KELVLALYMYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, displays log10 K50 values of -0.17 for trypsin and -1.52 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a dG of 1.38 and a ddG of -2.70; this mutation is classified as destabilizing.\n\n**Summary:** The D9M mutation leads to destabilization of the protein, with a ddG value indicating a considerable decrease in stability compared to the wild type.\n"
