Note that \"continuous sentence structure\" is challenging to maintain while being grammatically correct and clear, so I've opted for a slightly less rigidly continuous structure for readability.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_A6C:**  The protein 1QKX.pdb with mutation A6C (alanine to cysteine at position 6), has a DNA sequence TCCGCTGGCGGCTCCGCTGGCGGTTCTGCGGGCGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTCTGCCTGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTCAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCTGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCCGCGGGTGGTTCCGCGGGTGGCTCTGCTGGTGGT, resulting in an amino acid sequence KELVLCLYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL;  trypsin and chymotrypsin kinetic measurements yielded log10(K50) values of 1.58 and 0.67, respectively,  and a calculated deltaG of 4.05.  The mutation is classified as neutral based on the relatively small change in Gibbs Free Energy.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7N:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the L7N mutation (leucine to asparagine at position 7),  represented by the DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGTAAAGAACTCGTTCTGGCGAACTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGCGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGTGGTTCCGCTGGCGGC and amino acid sequence KELVLANYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, shows significantly decreased stability with log10(K50) values of -0.36 (trypsin) and -1.54 (chymotrypsin), and a deltaG of 0.95. This is classified as a destabilizing mutation.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7H:**  The 1QKX.pdb protein with the L7H mutation (leucine to histidine at position 7), with DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGTTCTGCTGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCATTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTCCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCTTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCCGCTGGCGGCTCTGCGGGCGGT and amino acid sequence KELVLAHYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, displays  log10(K50) values of -0.20 (trypsin) and -1.77 (chymotrypsin), and a deltaG of 0.67, indicating a substantial destabilization compared to the wild type.  This mutation is classified as destabilizing.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7E:** In protein 1QKX.pdb, the L7E mutation (leucine to glutamic acid at position 7), encoded by the DNA sequence TCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTGGCGGAATACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTCAATTCTACCAATAAGGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTGGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCTGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTCTCTGCTGGCGGCTCCGCTGGTGGT and resulting in the amino acid sequence KELVLAEYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL, exhibits  log10(K50) values of -0.02 (trypsin) and -1.33 (chymotrypsin), and a deltaG of 1.25. This  is classified as a destabilizing mutation.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_L7Q:** The 1QKX.pdb protein with the L7Q mutation (leucine to glutamine at position 7)  has a DNA sequence TCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGTAAAGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCAGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCCGCTGGTGGTTCTGCTGGCGGT and an amino acid sequence KELVLAQYDYQEKSPREVTMKKGDILTLLNSTNKDWWKVEVADRQGFVPAAYVKKL. The log10(K50) values are 0.17 (trypsin) and -1.13 (chymotrypsin), with a deltaG of 1.55. This mutation is classified as destabilizing.\n"
