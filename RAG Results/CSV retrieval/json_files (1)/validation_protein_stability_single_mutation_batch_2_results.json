I will interpret \"-\" as meaning the data is not available for that entry.\n\n\n**1QKX.pdb_K1A:** The protein 1QKX.pdb with the K1A mutation, whose DNA sequence is TCCGCGGGTGGTTCCGCTGGCGGTGCGGAACTGGTTCTGGCGCTCTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTATGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGT, shows a log10 K50 for trypsin of 1.67 and for chymotrypsin of 0.37, resulting in a calculated dG of 3.73. This mutation is classified as neutral, with a ddG of -0.36, indicating a slightly destabilizing effect, but not significant enough to change the overall classification.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_K1D:**  The K1D mutation in protein 1QKX.pdb, with DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGCTCTGCTGGCGGCGACGAACTGGTTCTCGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATTCTGACCCTGCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCTGCGTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCCGCTGGTGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT, exhibits log10 K50 values of 1.00 for trypsin and -0.15 for chymotrypsin, leading to a dG of 2.79. This is classified as a destabilizing mutation with a ddG of -1.30, significantly reducing the protein's stability compared to the wild type.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_K1R:**  The 1QKX.pdb protein with the K1R mutation and DNA sequence TCTGCTGGCGGCTCCGCGGGTGGTCGTGAACTCGTTCTGGCGCTGTATGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGTGACATCCTCACTCTGCTCAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGCTTCGTTCCGGCTGCGTATGTTAAAAAGCTGTCCGCTGGTGGTTCTGCGGGCGGT shows log10 K50 values of 1.85 for trypsin and 0.81 for chymotrypsin, yielding a dG of 4.21.  This mutation is classified as neutral, with a ddG of 0.13, suggesting a minimal impact on protein stability.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_K1S:** The K1S mutation in 1QKX.pdb, having the DNA sequence TCCGCGGGTGGCTCTGCGGGCGGTTCTGAACTCGTTCTGGCGCTGTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAGAAAGGCGACATCCTGACCCTGCTGAATTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCGTACGTTAAGAAACTGTCTGCTGGTGGTTCCGCTGGCGGT, displays log10 K50 values of 1.30 for trypsin and 0.02 for chymotrypsin, resulting in a dG of 3.22. This mutation is classified as destabilizing, with a ddG of -0.87, indicating a substantial decrease in protein stability.\n\n**1QKX.pdb_K1T:**  Protein 1QKX.pdb with the K1T mutation and DNA sequence TCTGCGGGCGGTTCCGCGGGTGGCACCGAACTGGTGCTCGCTCTCTACGACTACCAGGAAAAATCTCCGCGTGAAGTTACCATGAAAAAGGGTGACATCCTGACCCTCCTGAACTCTACCAACAAAGACTGGTGGAAAGTTGAAGTTGCGGACCGTCAGGGTTTCGTTCCAGCGGCTTACGTTAAAAAGCTGTCTGCTGGTGGCTCCGCTGGCGGT has log10 K50 values of 1.71 for trypsin and 0.48 for chymotrypsin, giving a dG of 3.76. This mutation is classified as neutral, with a ddG of -0.33, suggesting a minor destabilizing effect.\n"
