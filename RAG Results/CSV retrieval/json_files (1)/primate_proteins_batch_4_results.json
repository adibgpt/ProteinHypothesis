This protein has a peptide stretch, called the 'bait region' which contains specific cleavage sites for different proteinases. When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a conformational change is induced in the protein which traps the proteinase. The entrapped enzyme remains active against low molecular weight substrates (activity against high molecular weight substrates is greatly reduced). Following cleavage in the bait region, a thioester bond is hydrolyzed and mediates the covalent binding of the protein to the proteinase., Subcellular locations: Secreted, Secreted in plasma.\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** The human protein A2MG_HUMAN, a secreted plasma protein with the provided amino acid sequence, uniquely inhibits all four classes of proteinases through a trapping mechanism involving a bait region that, upon cleavage, covalently binds the proteinase.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** A2MG_HUMAN is a potent and unusual proteinase inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action, suggesting potential roles in regulating proteolytic activity in the plasma.\n\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** protein_name: 6PGL_HUMAN, species: Homo sapiens, sequence: MAAPAPGLISVFSSSQELGAALAQLVAQRAACCLAGARARFALGLSGGSLVSMLARELPAAVAPAGPASLARWTLGFCDERLVPFDHAESTYGLYRTHLLSRLPIPESQVITINPELPVEEAAEDYAKKLRQAFQGDSIPVFDLLILGVGPDGHTCSLFPDHPLLQEREKIVAPISDSPKPPPQRVTLTLPVLNAARTVIFVATGEGKAAVLKRILEDQEENPLPAALVQPHTGKLCWFLDEAAARLLTVPFEKHSTL, annotation: Hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconate., Subcellular locations: Cytoplasm\n\n2. **Sentence Description:** The human protein 6PGL_HUMAN, a cytoplasmic enzyme with the given amino acid sequence, catalyzes the hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconate.\n\n3. **Summary Statement:** 6PGL_HUMAN is a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, a crucial metabolic pathway.\n\n\n**Row 4:**\n\n1. **Column Names and Values:** protein_name: 8ODP_HUMAN, species: Homo sapiens, sequence: MGASRLYTLVLVLQPQRVLLGMKKRGFGAGRWNGFGGKVQEGETIEDGARRELQEESGLTVDALHKVGQIVFEFVGEPELMDVHVFCTDSIQGTPVESDEMRPCWFQLDQIPFKDMWPDDSYWFPLLLQKKKFHGYFKFQGQDTILDYTLREVDTV, annotation: Oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase which is a prominent sanitizer of the oxidized nucleotide pool (    ).
