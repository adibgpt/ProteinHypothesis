I can, however, describe each row individually as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1:** The alpaca named Christy, a female, produced a VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGSPFDYYAIGWFRQAPGKEREGVSCISGSASGSSTNYADSVKGRFTISRDNAKNTVYLQMNSLKPEDTAVYYCAADRGRYGSSWYDPEMYDYWGQGTQVTVSS) that showed no binding  (label: 0) to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.\n\n**Row 2:**  Alpaca Christy, a female, generated a VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGTVRPGGSLTLSCAASGGTLDVWNIGWFRQTPVKEREGVSCISKSGDSTYYSDSVKGRFTISRDNAKNTVYLQMNSLKLEDTAVYYFCAARRSITIQTMCRQPLGGGQGTQVTVSS) which did not bind (label: 0) to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.\n\n**Row 3:** From female alpaca Christy, a VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCVASGFTFSSYVMSWVRQAPGKGREWVSDINSGGGTTYYADSVKGRFTIARDNAKNTLYLQMNGLKPEDTAVYYCAKAKRSTVVAGTIFDDHDYYGQGTQVTVSS) was obtained; this sequence did not bind (label: 0) to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.\n\n**Row 4:** Female alpaca Christy produced a VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGVSLNPFAIGWFRQAPGKEREAVSCINVGGYSMNYIDSLKGRFAISRDNSKKTVYLQMNSLEPEDTAVYYCAARVMTCMDDANIPSYTYWGQGTQVTVSS) that did not bind (label: 0) to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.\n\n**Row 5:**  A VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTLDYNSIGWFRQAPGKEREGISCISPSGDTTNYADSVKGRFTISRDNAKNTVYLQMNSLKPEDTALYYCAAATPSYHYCSGYVSEYDDWGQGTQVTVSS) from female alpaca Christy showed binding (label: 1) to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.\n\n\n**Summary:**  All sequences originated from the same female alpaca, Christy. Four out of five VHH sequences did not bind to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen, while one did.  This suggests variability in the antibody response of this alpaca to the specific antigen.  Further analysis would be needed to understand the reasons behind this variability.\n"
