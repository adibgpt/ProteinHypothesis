Each row represents a VHH sequence from an alpaca named Christy,  with its associated antigen label (Alpha+E484K_cell), a binary label (0 or 1), and the subject's species and sex.  For example, one row shows a VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCATNRFTLDRYDIAWFRQAPGKGREGVSCFSRAGSSANYADPVKGRFTISIDSAKNTVYLQMNNLKPEDTAVYYCAAAPIPKCSMYVYDYDWSGQGTQVTVSS) from a female alpaca named Christy, where the antigen label is Alpha+E484K_cell and the binary label is 0.  Another row shows a different VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTLDRYTFGWFRQVPGKEREGVSYMSSSGSDMHYADSVKGRFTMSRDNVKPMVYLQMNSLKLEDTGVYYCAARPVIFGGMGDLDSKKYFYWGQGTQVTVSS) from the same subject, but with a binary label of 1, suggesting a potential difference in the binding properties of these sequences to the Alpha+E484K antigen.  Further analysis would require more data to determine any patterns or correlations.\n"
