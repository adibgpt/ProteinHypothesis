Each row represents a VHH sequence from an alpaca named Christy,  a female alpaca,  with the antigen label \"Alpha+E484K_cell\" and a label value of 0.  The VHH sequences vary slightly, suggesting different antibody variants generated by the alpaca in response to the Alpha+E484K cell antigen.  The consistent label of 0 might indicate a negative response or a lack of binding affinity. More information is needed to draw definitive conclusions.\n"
