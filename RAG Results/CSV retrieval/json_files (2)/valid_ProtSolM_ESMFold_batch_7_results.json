I will treat each block of key-value pairs as a single row.\n\n\n**Row 1 (protein_2711):**  The protein, named protein_2711, is labeled as 0 and detailed as CESG-GO.19253, with a work status of \"work stopped\"; its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is MGNCLMGGNNVEKMVKEEEVMKKEYKRKDRKVKIVLRRDELEKLILFQLNANGNVDGKGETTLASFGDFLRELEAERSAGEAAAKAAEEEEESRRRCRKWRPSLERITEWPEETLS.  This suggests that the protein's annotation process from CESG-GO.19253 was halted, resulting in a label of 0.\n\n**Row 2 (protein_51331):** Protein 51331, labeled as 1, is identified as 1OTR_1|Chain A|protein Cue2|Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4932), indicating it's a Cue2 protein from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*; its amino acid sequence is NDDHESKLSILMDMFPAISKSKLQVHLLENNNDLDLTIGLLLKENDDKS. The label of 1 suggests this protein is likely characterized or annotated differently than those with label 0.\n\n**Row 3 (protein_47511):** Protein 47511, labeled 0, is detailed as CESG-GO.34683 with a \"work stopped\" status; its long amino acid sequence (MEDGKQAINEGSNDASPDLDVNGTILMNNEDFSQWSVDDVITWCISTLEVEETDPLCQRLRENDIVGDLLPELCLQDCQDLCDGDLNKAIKFKILINKMRDSKLEWKDDKTQEDMITVLKNLYTTTSAKLQEFQSQYTRLRMDVLDVMKTSSSSSPINTHGVSTTVPSSNNTIIPSSDGVSLSQTDYFDTVHNRQSPSRRESPVTVFRQPSLSHSKSLHKDSKNKVPQISTNQSHPSAVSTANTPGPSPNEALKQLRASKEDSCERILKNAMKRHNLADQDWRQYVLVICYGDQERLLELNEKPVIIFKNLKQQGLHPAIMLRRRGDFEEVAMMNGSDNVTPGGRL) indicates a substantial protein with annotation work halted, resulting in a label of 0.\n\n**Row 4 (protein_23965):**  Protein 23965, labeled 0, originates from CESG-GO.37029 and has a \"work stopped\" status; its extensive amino acid sequence (MQSKRDCELWCERVNPENKAALEAWVRETGIRLVQVNGQRKYGGPPPGWVGSPPPAGSEVFIGRLPQDVYEHQLIPLFQRVGRLYEFRLMMTFSGLNRGFAYARYSSRRGAQAAIATLHNHPLRPSCPLLVCRSTEKCELSVDGLPPNLTRSALLLALQPLGPGLQEARLLPSPGPAPGQIALLKFSSHRAAAMAKKALVEGQSHLCGEQVAVEWLKPDLKQRLRQQLVGPFLRSPQPEGSQLALARDKLGFQGARATLQLLCQRMKLGSPVFLTKCLGIGPAGWHRFWYQVVIPGHPVPFSGLIWVVLTLDGRDGHEVAKDAVSVRLLQALSESGANLLWSAGAEAGTMVKQ) suggests a large protein where annotation from CESG-GO.37029 was interrupted, resulting in a label of 0.\n\n**Row 5 (protein_2575):** Protein 2575, labeled 0, is linked to CESG-GO.58765 with \"work stopped\" status;  its amino acid sequence (MTRDDDDDEDDEEEEDSGAWGRESYAFDGFHPTEEFGFSFSPRGGMRFHGNFGFDDLVRDFNSIFSEMGAWTLPSHSPELPGPESETPGVRLREGQTLRDSMLKYPDSHQPRIFEGVLESHAKPESSKPAPDWGSQGPFHRLDDTWPVSPHSRAREDKDLDSQVSQEGLGPLLQPQPKSYFKSISVTKITKPDGTVEEHRTVVDGEGRRETTVTHQEAHDSSRSDPDPPRSSALDDPFSILDLLLGRWFRSR) shows a protein with annotation from CESG-GO.58765 that was also halted, resulting in a label of 0.\n\n\n**Summary:** The data shows five proteins.  Four proteins (protein_2711, protein_47511, protein_23965, protein_2575) share a label of 0 and are associated with the CESG-GO database, with annotation work having stopped in each case.  One protein (protein_51331) has a label of 1 and is identified as a Cue2 protein from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, suggesting a different data source and annotation process. The label seems to distinguish between completed and incomplete protein annotation.\n"
