The label 0 and the detail suggest this protein's analysis was incomplete or stopped before completion.\n\n\n**protein_56921:** Protein_56921, labeled 1, is identified as \"7YCA_20|Chain T[auth N]|Photosystem I PsaN, reaction centre subunit N|Ostreococcus tauri (70448)\" and has a shorter amino acid sequence (aa_seq) beginning with \"MYTVCGANIIAAKAPTAAKKQDKVKRAVSLGLAGLAAATVSVAPAHADLTADLLARTEANKSLNDQKRAATSSANFERSRLVTDGFCQFPQNIFGCQNAAEKGSVKFLSDDMAIECEGTADGKTCSSKAPGAYPSFLGL\". The label 1 and the detailed identifier strongly suggest this protein is a Photosystem I subunit from *Ostreococcus tauri*, indicating a completed and characterized protein.\n\n\n**protein_44798:** Protein_44798, labeled 1, is a ribosomal protein L37AE from *Haloarcula marismortui* (2238), as indicated by the detail \"1FFK_25|Chain Y[auth W]|RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L37AE|Haloarcula marismortui (2238)\". Its amino acid sequence (aa_seq), starting with \"PTGRFGPRYGLKIRVRVRDVEIKHKKKYKCPVCGFPKLKRASTSIWVCGHCGYKIAGGAYTPETVAGKAVMKA\", is relatively short. The label 1 suggests this protein is well-characterized.\n\n\n**protein_57237:**  Protein_57237 is labeled 1 and identified as \"2JPJ_1|Chain A|Bacteriocin lactococcin-G subunit alpha|Lactococcus lactis (1358)\", indicating a bacteriocin subunit from *Lactococcus lactis*. Its amino acid sequence (aa_seq), beginning with \"GTWDDIGQGIGRVAYWVGKALGNLSDVNQASRINRKKKH\", is quite short.  The label 1 suggests this protein is well-studied.\n\n\n**protein_23749:** Protein_23749, with label 0, has the detail \"CESG-GO.33369 $ 1 $ CESG $ work stopped $ 1 $ label=0\" and a long amino acid sequence (aa_seq) starting with \"SETGAGIGLYPLHRCKTIYLVRHAQGIHNVDGEKNYKAYMSHDYFDAELTQLGWKQVDSLRKHVHSSGLHKKIELVISSPLMRTLQTAVGVFGGEGYTDMSDVLPLMVANAGNSSRAAISSLNCPPVITEESCREHLGVHPCDQRRSISDYQFLFPAVDFSLIESEEDKLWKADVRETIEELAARGKKFLNWLWTRKEKEIAIVTHSGFLFHTLNALQNECHPDVKKEICGHFANCELRSMVIVDRSMLGSDSSVTDYPGKIPKGIDLPSDAVVDDNNIKVE\". Similar to protein_30394, the label 0 and the detail suggest this protein's analysis was also incomplete or stopped prematurely.\n"
