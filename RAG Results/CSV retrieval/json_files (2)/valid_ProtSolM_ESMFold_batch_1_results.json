This suggests the protein is associated with the NYCOMPS project, where work has stopped, and its label of 0 may indicate a negative outcome or a specific experimental condition.\n\n\n**protein_9023:** Protein_9023, labeled as 1, is identified as \"6VK9_2|Chains AA[auth 1], BA[auth 3], CA[auth 5], DA[auth B], EA[auth D], FA[auth F], Q[auth H], R[auth J], S[auth L], T[auth N], U[auth P], V[auth R], W[auth T], X[auth V], Y[auth X], Z|Geopilin domain 2 protein|Geobacter sulfurreducens (35554)\" and possesses the amino acid sequence AGKIPTTTMGGKDFTFKPSTNVSVSYFTTNGATSTAGTVNTDYAVNTKNSSGNRVFTSTNNTSNIWYIENDAWKGKAVSDSDVTALGTGDVGKSDFSGTEWKSQ.  The label of 1 and its identification as a Geopilin domain 2 protein from *Geobacter sulfurreducens* suggests this protein is likely a positive control or has a known function relevant to the study.\n\n\n**protein_19873:** The protein, protein_19873, is labeled 1, detailed as \"5ZMB_1|Chain A|ubiquintin-like protein|Trypanosoma brucei brucei TREU927 (185431)\", and its amino acid sequence is MSETIPVSVQCCEGRFELSVDSNHTLRDVLRQFKREVAALDPINLEEYVVNHEGKLLLDDSVTLQTVGVKKDSVFVLVRKA.  The label of 1 and identification as a ubiquitin-like protein from *Trypanosoma brucei* indicates this protein is likely of interest and may play a role in ubiquitination pathways.\n\n\n**protein_27689:** Protein_27689, labeled as 1, is described as \"6RPQ_1|Chain A|Ubiquitin-like protein SMT3,1108aa long hypothetical cell division control protein|Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (559292)\" and has the amino acid sequence GSSHHHHHHSTSDSEVNQEAKPEVKPEVKPETHINLKVSDGSSEIFFKIKKTTPLRRLMEAFAKRQGKEMDSLRFLYDGIRIQADQTPEDLDMEDNDIIETHREQIGGSGKAVDYDTEVLLGDGRKRKIGEIVEEAIKKAEKEGKLGRVDDGFYAPINLELYALDVRTLKVRKVKADIAWKRTTPEKMLRIRTKRGREIRVTPTHPFFTLEEGRIKTKKAYELKVGEKIATPREEAPEAEIFWDEVVEIEEYKPNNSWVYDLQVPEHHNFIANGIFVHN.  The label of 1, identification as a ubiquitin-like protein, and association with cell division control in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* suggest its importance in cellular processes.\n\n\n**protein_15500:**  Protein_15500, labeled 1, is detailed as \"NYSGXRC-10238c $ 2 $ NYSGXRC $ soluble $ 2\" and has the amino acid sequence MSLGSPIRGNDVLHLLVDDPTRADPLVAGLLQRLLVVVTKEVIEKELSTDLDRDGDDLLHDGRKLTVSVFKPAGPGSLAHLGINVTTEGVPVPASSLRDLGYRGDPLDLGRRVAVEFVREITDVELDLTKIREGHHHHHH.  The label of 1 and description as \"soluble\" from the NYSGXRC project suggest this protein is likely a successfully expressed and purified protein,  implicating a positive result in the experiment.\n"
