        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, formatted as requested:\n\n\n**Row 1:**\n\n1. Column Names and Values: `protein_name: MT3_PRUAV`, `species: Prunus avium`, `sequence: MSSKCSNCDCSDSSQCTKKGYSFDLVIVETENRSMDTVIMDAPAAENGGNCKCGPSCACVDCKC`, `annotation: Metallothioneins have a high content of cysteine residues that bind various heavy metals.`\n\n2. Sentence:  The *Prunus avium* protein MT3_PRUAV, with the amino acid sequence MSSKCSNCDCSDSSQCTKKGYSFDLVIVETENRSMDTVIMDAPAAENGGNCKCGPSCACVDCKC, is annotated as a metallothionein, characterized by its high cysteine content enabling binding to various heavy metals.\n\n3. Summary: This row describes a metallothionein protein from sweet cherry, highlighting its key functional characteristic of heavy metal binding through cysteine residues.\n\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n1. Column Names and Values: `protein_name: METK2_DAUCA`, `species: Daucus carota`, `sequence: MDTFLNTSESVNEGHPDKLCDQISDAVLDACLEQDPDSKVACETCSKTNMVMVFGEITTKANVDYEKIVRKTCRDIGFVSDDVGLDADNCKVLVQIEQQSPDIAQGVHGHLTKRPEDIGAGDQGHMFGYATDETPELMPLSHVLATKLGAKLTEVRKNGTCPWLRPDGKTQVTVEYYNDKGAMVPIRVHTVLISTQHDETVTNDEIAADLKEHVIKPIIPAKYLDEKTIFHLNPSGRFVIGGPHGDAGLTGRMIIIDTYGGWGAHGGGAFSGKDPTKVDRSGAYIVRQAAKSIVANGLARRCIVQVSYAIGVPDPLSVFVDSYGTGNIPDKEILKIVKETFDFRPGMIAINLDLKRGGNNRFLKTAAYGHFGRDDADFTWEVVKPLKWEKPQA`, `annotation: Catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine and ATP. The reaction comprises two steps that are both catalyzed by the same enzyme: formation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and triphosphate, and subsequent hydrolysis of the triphosphate.`, `Subcellular locations: Cytoplasm`\n\n2. Sentence: The *Daucus carota* protein METK2_DAUCA, a cytoplasmic enzyme with a long amino acid sequence (MDTFLNTSESVNEGHPDKLCDQISDAVLDACLEQDPDSKVACETCSKTNMVMVFGEITTKANVDYEKIVRKTCRDIGFVSDDVGLDADNCKVLVQIEQQSPDIAQGVHGHLTKRPEDIGAGDQGHMFGYATDETPELMPLSHVLATKLGAKLTEVRKNGTCPWLRPDGKTQVTVEYYNDKGAMVPIRVHTVLISTQHDETVTNDEIAADLKEHVIKPIIPAKYLDEKTIFHLNPSGRFVIGGPHGDAGLTGRMIIIDTYGGWGAHGGGAFSGKDPTKVDRSGAYIVRQAAKSIVANGLARRCIVQVSYAIGVPDPLSVFVDSYGTGNIPDKEILKIVKETFDFRPGMIAINLDLKRGGNNRFLKTAAYGHFGRDDADFTWEVVKPLKWEKPQA), catalyzes the two-step formation of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine and ATP.\n\n3. Summary: This row details a carrot  S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAM synthetase), specifying its enzymatic function, subcellular location, and lengthy amino acid sequence.\n\n\n**Rows 3, 4, and 5:**\n\nRows 3, 4, and 5 all describe variations of the same protein, MATK, from different *Prunus* species (*Prunus persica*, *Prunus laurocerasus*, and *Prunus dulcis* respectively).  They share similar annotations and subcellular locations.  Due to the length and similarity of the descriptions, a generalized description follows:\n\n\n1. Column Names and Values (Generalized): `protein_name: MATK_[species abbreviation]`, `species: Prunus [species name]`, `sequence: [long amino acid sequence - varies slightly between rows]`, `annotation: Usually encoded in the trnK tRNA gene intron. Probably assists in splicing its own and other chloroplast group II introns.`, `Subcellular locations: Plastid, Chloroplast`\n\n2. Sentence (Generalized):  The *Prunus* [species name] protein MATK_[species abbreviation], located in the plastid and chloroplast, has a long amino acid sequence ([sequence]) and is typically encoded within the trnK tRNA gene intron, likely functioning as a maturase to assist in the splicing of its own and other chloroplast group II introns.\n\n3. Summary (Generalized): These three rows represent homologous proteins from different *Prunus* species, all showing characteristics of a chloroplast group II intron maturase, suggesting a conserved role in RNA splicing within the chloroplast.  The minor sequence variations likely reflect species-specific adaptations.\n"
