Each row represents a VHH sequence from an alpaca named Christy, female,  with the antigen label `Alpha+E484K_cell` and a label of 0.  The VHH sequences themselves vary, suggesting different antibody variants generated by the alpaca in response to the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 with the E484K mutation.  The consistent `label` of 0 might indicate a negative response or lack of binding, but further information is needed to interpret this definitively.\n"
