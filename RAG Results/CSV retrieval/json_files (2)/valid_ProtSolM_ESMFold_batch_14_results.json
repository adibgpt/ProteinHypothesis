Its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is MAISVHDPEVRSPQFSSSRMHVQIGDDFIQAGWTAGQNQCYNSLCPAGIILVRSDIPLGGLRGPPGVRGSTQIVYDTYGLLKDKANGNWWLEFGGIQIGFWPANIFQQSLANSVEWGGEVYSASLPGPRMGNGYFPLLDPVDDAHVCNITLVDENFKVDKMVKNIETFSDNNHSYKVYEDLDSGLPVGHIIYFGGPGKM.  This suggests that the protein's production or study was halted during the process.\n\n**protein_21191:** Protein_21191, labeled 1, originates from the JCSG-358444 project (stage 8), resulting in diffraction-quality crystals (indicated by a 0 in the detail column). The amino acid sequence is EEMEKGFDPKRYARELWFKLQDMMNEGLGYDAVEVLNTLDENPELAHQKFAKVVGVSNYRYYIIQGVGEIVEIKDDGILVKVRENRKVPDLFLSNHIFGNGIVNATGIAKMEDFDRIIDFNLTATELNKIVKEEVVNSFLKQLSKGAGSVGSLVRFIAVFTLLKDEEIKYPIEAIPLYLEIQGGF, which is consistent with successful crystallization.  This indicates successful progress in structural determination.\n\n**protein_52515:** Protein_52515, labeled 1, comes from the NESG-HR6296 project (stage 29) and is described as soluble (indicated by a 1 in the detail column).  Its long amino acid sequence, MSGLNDIFEAQKIEWHEHHHHHHHHGSDSEVNQEAKPEVKPEVKPETHINLKVSDGSSEIFFKIKKTTPLRRLMEAFAKRQGKEMDSLRFLYDGIRIQADQAPEDLDMEDNDIIEAHREQIGGPENLYFQSHMAAAGARPVELGFAESAPAWRLRSEQFPSKVGGRPAWLGAAGLPGPQALACELCGRPLSFLLQVYAPLPGRPDAFHRCIFLFCCREQPCCAGLRVFRNQLPRKNDFYSYEPPSENPPPETGESVCLQLKSGAHLCRVCGCLGPKTCSRCHKAYYCSKEHQTLDWRLGHKQACAQPDHLDHIIPDHNFLFPEFEIVIETEDEIMPEVVEKEDYSEIIGSMGEALEEELDSMAKHESREDKIFQKFKTQIALEPEQILRYGRGIAPIWISGENIPQEKDIPDCPCGAKRILEFQVMPQLLNYLKADRLGKSIDWGILAVFTCAESCSLGTGYTEEFVWKQDVTDTP, suggests a successful expression and purification process due to its solubility.\n\n\n**protein_16717:** Protein_16717, labeled 0, belongs to the MCSG-APC86606 project (stage 1) and has work stopped (indicated by a 1 in the detail column). The amino acid sequence is MYYKFGEIKNKIISFNGFEFKVSAMKKHDGISIQVKDMNNVPLKSFHVVDLSELYIAMDAMRDVINEWIEENTDERDRLINLVMRW. The project halted early in its process.\n\n**protein_15816:** Protein_15816 is labeled 1 and comes from the SECSG-Son-SO3811 project (stage 1) and is described as soluble (indicated by a 1 in the detail column). Its amino acid sequence, MKRLLLTLTFPLFFVGCASQNPTHMAFSPQVPDISQQTSRPVQISLDTIDSRNAEYVARFMEEGTKTRLVGPSEPPKLLLDEVFRNGFTQAGYQIDPSATNSIQVQLEELQMDVTKKTFGYEAKHSVRIAVQARNSSQELVKRYKAKGVLKGPLTPDFATLEMDMNKLLGQLTGEILNDPELNQFLQK, along with the solubility annotation, suggests successful protein expression and purification.\n"
