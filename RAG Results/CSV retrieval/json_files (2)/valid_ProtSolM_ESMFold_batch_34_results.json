This suggests that the CESG project, GO.80182, had its work stopped after 2 attempts (indicated by the '$2$' and 'work stopped' in the detail field).  The label '0' likely indicates failure or incompletion.\n\n**protein_45146:** Protein_45146 is labeled as 1, identified as \"2DO7_1|Chain A|Cullin-4B|Homo sapiens (9606)\", and possesses the amino acid sequence GSSGSSGIQMKETVEEQASTTERVFQDRQYQIDAAIVRIMKMRKTLSHNLLVSEVYNQLKFPVKPADLKKRIESLIDRDYMERDKENPNQYNYIASGPSSG. The label '1' and the detail suggesting it's a human Cullin-4B protein indicate successful identification and characterization of this specific protein.\n\n**protein_62177:** Protein_62177, labeled 1 and detailed as \"NYSGXRC-10464a $ 1 $ NYSGXRC $ crystallized $ 2\", has the amino acid sequence MSLEALLSEDVKIIASALKAAIDKDRKSTSKREAETGIRYYNHENDIMNNRIFYVDDEGVLREDKYASNVRIPHGFFPEIVDQKTQYLLSNPVEYETENEELKEYLAEYYNSEFQVVLQELVEGSSQKGFEYVYARTNAEDRLCFQVADSLNVFGVYNEYNELQRICRHYITEIEKDGETVDIHHAEVWTDQNVYFFVAEDNKDYELDEAEPINPRPHVLAVDSDNESLLQRSYGQIPFYRLSNNKQETTDLKSIKALIDDYDLMNCFLSNNLQDFAEAIYVVSGFQGDDLSKLRQNVKSKKVVGTGSDGGLDVKTVTIPTEGRKTKMEIDKENIYKFGMAFDSTQVGDGNITNIVIKARYTLLNMKANKTEARLRALLEWMNKLVIDDINRRYTKAFDPTEVSFTFTREVMVNETDIVNNEKTEAETRKIILESILQVAPRLDDDNVLRLICEQFDLDWEDVKEALEEAEYTQGLTDNTDEEETAEGHHHHHH.
