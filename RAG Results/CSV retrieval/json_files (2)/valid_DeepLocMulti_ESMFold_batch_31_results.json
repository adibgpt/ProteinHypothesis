The label 4 suggests a classification within a specific group of transmembrane proteins.\n\n\n**Row 2 - Row 5:**  The analysis would follow the same structure as above for rows with names P31321, Q9FFZ7, Q9DBI0, and Q9EPX4 respectively.  Each would detail the values for the five columns (name, aa_seq, foldseek_seq, ss8_seq, label, location) in a similar sentence structure, highlighting the relationships between the amino acid sequence, predicted secondary structure, transmembrane topology, and label. The summary statement would offer interpretation based on the specific features of each protein.  Due to the length of the sequences, I will not repeat the process for each protein here, but the procedure remains consistent.\n"
