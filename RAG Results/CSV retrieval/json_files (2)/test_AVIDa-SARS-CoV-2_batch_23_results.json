Four sequences showed no binding to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen, while one sequence exhibited binding.  This suggests variability in antibody response even within a single animal.  Further analysis would be needed to determine the significance of the amino acid differences between the binding and non-binding VHH sequences.\n"
