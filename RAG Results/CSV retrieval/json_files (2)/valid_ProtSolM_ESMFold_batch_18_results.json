        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**protein_47644:**  The protein, named protein_47644, has a label of 0 and a detail string indicating it's associated with CESG-GO.59511, with a work status of \"work stopped\". Its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is MFKADLGTIGIQLHTTYSRRIRKVKVMDNRKEPPFFNEDNVGPFYFKLPFYDPMELFIETLTGTCFELRVSPFEAVISVKGKIQRLEGIPICQQHLIWNNMELEDDYCLNDYNISEGCTLKLVLAMRGGPISTRKVPVEDPLRELAEYMDSSRDEVWEKTSCNKQVTFLVYREGDQLNFFRVVDRGDGTLTPLSESLSGGSVYNLYTDEDEETEPSPSGQQIIENSITMNKMKLLKAKMENMNLSKKVKPLAVRQAFL.  This suggests a protein from a CESG project that was halted, and its amino acid sequence is available for further analysis.\n\n**protein_22520:** Protein 22520 is labeled 1 and identified as 3BZH_1|Chain A|Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1|Homo sapiens (9606), indicating a human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.  Its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is GMSDDDSRASTSSSSSSSSNQQTEKETNTPKKKESKVSMSKNSKLLSTSAKRIQKELADITLDPPPNCSAGPKGDNIYEWRSTILGPPGSVYEGGVFFLDITFTPEYPFKPPKVTFRTRIYHCNINSQGVICLDILKDNWSPALTISKVLLSICSLLTDCNPADPLVGSIATQYMTNRAEHDRMARQWTKRYAT. The label 1 might signify a positive classification or experimental outcome related to this enzyme.\n\n**protein_31184:**  Protein 31184, labeled 1, is associated with MCSG-APC101217 and is described as soluble.  The amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is MGDVLMLVTNEDASFYRQQVDALEDLGLNCDTVAVPNSEDGTRRLRHYARFYGATLRKSLSEYDVVHANYGLTAPAALAQRRRPVVLSLWGSDLLGSYGRLSTWCANRCDEVIVMSDAMATELDRDAHVIPHGVDMERFSPTAQASARDELGWDQNARIVLFPYDPERPIKDFPRARAVVDDAASRLDGHVALRTVSGVDHGEIPRYMNATDVMLLTSRREGSPNTVKEALACNCPVVSTDVGDVSDYVAALDYSGVCADDDELVERLVATLRAAPVSEGREQVAALGLPEMARNIASVYRRAGARGVTVDG. The label 1, combined with the solubility description, suggests this protein is likely functional and successfully expressed.\n\n**protein_58009:** Protein 58009, labeled 0, is linked to NESG-HR4456A with a \"work stopped\" status. Its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is VPPDTLHSLPKSQVKRQEVISELLVTEAAHVRMLRVLHDLFFQPMAECLFFPLEELQNIFPSLDELIEVHSLFLDRLMKRRQESGYLIEEIGDVLLARFDGAEGSWFQKISSRFCSRQSFALEQLKAKQRKDPRFCAFVQEAESRPRCRRLQLKDMIPTEMQRLTKYPLLLQSIGQNTEEPTEREKVELAAECCREILHHVNQAVRDMEDLLRLKDYQRRLDLSHLRQSSDPMLSEFKNLDITKKKLVHEGPLTWRVTKDKAVEVHV.  Similar to protein_47644, the label 0 and \"work stopped\" status indicate an unsuccessful or incomplete project.\n\n**protein_47141:** Protein 47141, with a label of 0, is associated with MCSG-APC60464.1 and also marked as \"work stopped\". Its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is GLEIRVVKSPEELADYAAVLSANWNPPAETVQRFYTEAAEYALRKNSPALYLVGYAGNRAVCSAEAFIHASVVGIYNISTLEHKRRRGYGGAITLATLHTARNAGCDTAVLQASEDGEPVYRKLGFTDCGRFTEY.  The 0 label and \"work stopped\" status again suggest that the project was unsuccessful or incomplete.\n"
