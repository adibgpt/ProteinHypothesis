        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested:\n\n\n**protein_58022:**  The protein, named protein_58022, is labeled as 0, detailed as \"NESG-HR45 $ 1 $ NESG $ work stopped $ 1 $ label=0\", and has the amino acid sequence GKVISASRVSMEHFEFQGYRQSFPVWLRPPRGSRAFRLQTDPCSCRCLHDRPSSCGSLGMLRGSDMKGPCEPIVLSPAALSSSSLINGPVRPRHWAPEDSPLPPAAMWTWCKLRTSCWSSHACSVGDALVFTALRIVEILY.  This suggests the protein is associated with NESG, work on it has stopped, and its function is currently unknown due to the label 0.\n\n**protein_63015:** Protein 63015, labeled as 1, is identified as \"6IL9_1|Chain A|Fructuronate-tagaturonate epimerase UxaE from Cohnella laeviribosi in complex with 1 glycerol|Cohnella laeviribosi (380174) label=1\" and possesses the amino acid sequence SMKAQSIIERLAAGQVHVYPRSRHESEGTRVQMIKAEGRKYLVAEGSGKLYDELRGEEADGVKLCELSHENRLVLNRHFPFTVPQAFGKQSATIGLGDRLGIAGPGHVQTVRGRAIHPILAQQSIRELALTGRDYKQVIDAAAYAVFQEGYTEGYGADGDHLKKEEDIRMALDLGFTMLTLDCSEQIDNEAAQAGESEVKRKYEELPESVRSHYEAKYLDKTFQVGPHAIHFDAATLMRDVLVYREAIQFMIYIYEKYIQTAGRAVDFEISIDETLTPTAPGSHFLVASELIGKNVDIFSMAPRFIGEFQKGIDYIGDIAQFERELAVHAAIADRFGYKLSIHSGSDKFSVFALVGRYTNGRFHVKTAGTNWLEAVRIVAKTNPGLYRRMHQYALEHFEEATAYYHVTTNLNNIRPLADVSDEELPSYMNENDARQLLHITYGLLLQAKKDDGSSLFRDEFFRTLSEREEDYEAALRSHIGKHLDLLGVK. The label 1 and detailed description indicate this protein is a fructuronate-tagaturonate epimerase from Cohnella laeviribosi, likely involved in carbohydrate metabolism.\n\n\n**protein_46081:** Protein 46081, labeled 1, is detailed as \"5CWS_6|Chains F, L|Nucleoporin NIC96|Chaetomium thermophilum (strain DSM 1495 / CBS 144.50 / IMI 039719) (759272) label=1\" and has the amino acid sequence SALFDSLLARNKKQAEGETALGELPSLQLGLADLRQRLRKLGPSSDRPIEPGKAHYFLAASGVDPGAAVRDLGA.  The label 1 and description identify this as a nucleoporin NIC96 from Chaetomium thermophilum, suggesting a role in nuclear transport.\n\n\n**protein_16350:** Protein 16350, labeled 0, is detailed as \"NESG-VT109A $ 2 $ NESG $ work stopped $ 1 $ label=0\" and has the amino acid sequence LTRQQKELIVKEMSEIFKKTSLILFADFLGFTVADLTELRSRLREKYGDGARFRVVKNTLLNLALKNAEYEGYEEFLKGPTAVLYVTEGDPVEAVKIIYNFYK.  Similar to protein_58022, the label 0 and details suggest this protein is associated with NESG, work has stopped, and its function remains unknown.\n\n\n**protein_20551:** Protein 20551, labeled 0, is detailed as \"NESG-FR245 $ 1 $ NESG $ work stopped $ 1 $ label=0\" and has a long amino acid sequence MLSQLLQAFQRLVSQLKSQFVWVRCWLPFPRHFYGFRRETESRARLRLRVREQLRRNPANRASHQRNRRTQRRHLVMDYIFECFFDDTFEQISRNGLQDRQSRRDVLDHLSSIIKGCSGGQNSQTDEVAAIAVTAAMRYHRMAKEQNGQVCLMGKYHNILYIGLRTCWDWGVRDSEVVVKLLVAIYECEKTYERIFLGALFGPHAPHFIAGWRSDFQDQHENVRAMVYFLKHATREQLTLPVWIPRFEQERQLRFIDVPIESCGKSSPLRIALQANAPELLLILLR.  Like the other proteins labeled 0, it's associated with NESG, work has stopped, and its function is undetermined.\n"
