Therefore, a detailed description following the requested format for each row will be provided.\n\n\n**Row 1:** The alpaca named Christy, a female, produced a VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQSGGSLRLSCAASTYTSGYYAIAWFRQAPGKEREGVSCLNLIIGITNYADSVKGRFTISRDNAKNTVFLQMNSLKPEDTAVYYCAAKRLHLPGSDCPLSAPYGTWGQGTQVTVSS) that showed a label of 0 against the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.  This indicates a lack of binding or a negative response in this specific instance.\n\n**Row 2:**  Alpaca Christy, a female, generated another VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGSVQPGGSLRLSCTSSGDTLDGYAIGWFRQAPGKGRGGREGVSCISSSGDMRNYADSAKGRFTISRDFAKNIVFLQMNSLKPEDTAVYYCAADFSHSCPMDVFGTYDYWGQGTQVTVSS) which also received a label of 0 against the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen, suggesting no detectable binding or interaction.\n\n**Row 3:**  From female alpaca Christy, a third VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGSVQPGGSLRLSCTASGSTLDVYAVGWYRQAPGKEREVVSCISSSGGTTTYADSVKGRFTISRDNAKNTVYLQMNSLKPGDTASYYCAANRRSTKICVGPDFGSWGQGTQVTVSS) was obtained and similarly labeled as 0 for the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen, again indicating no positive binding.\n\n**Row 4:**  A fourth VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCTTSKFTLGPYAMGWFRQAPGKEREGVSCISVSGDSSNYADSVKGRFTISRDNAKNTVYLEMNSLKPEDTAVYYCAVPVWYTVSTCPNDYESYGQGTQVTVSS) from female alpaca Christy was tested against the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen and received a label of 0, consistent with the previous results.\n\n**Row 5:** The final VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFGSNWMNWVRQAPGKGLEWVSGITTGRGTTYYADFVKGRFTISSDNAKNTLYLQMNSLKPEDTAVYYCANVVGGSSWSGVDYWGKGTQVTVSS) from female alpaca Christy also resulted in a label of 0 when tested against the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen, maintaining the pattern of negative responses.\n\n\n**Summary:** All five VHH sequences generated by female alpaca Christy showed no binding affinity (label 0) to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.  This suggests that these particular VHH sequences are not effective at targeting this specific antigen.\n"
