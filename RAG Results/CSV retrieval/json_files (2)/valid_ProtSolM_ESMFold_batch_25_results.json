        "response": "Here's an analysis of the provided data, presented as requested.  Note that the data is not in CSV format; it's presented as a series of key-value pairs.  I will treat each block of key-value pairs as a single \"row.\"\n\n**Protein_64551:**  The protein, named protein_64551, has a label of 0 and details indicating it's associated with CESG-GO.2232, work has stopped, and the label confirms its class as 0; its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is MAEWSKAPDSSSGLRKRAWIRPWQREHMTIESVDHETRSMTQRFTVPEFFEGYKMITSTTKVNDSAIGLYSLVDISVEYDKTGPEIKDLDQVQFLVDYINELVLRTGGQLLRRLK.  This suggests a protein from a project that was halted, belonging to class 0 based on its label.\n\n**Protein_26055:** Protein_26055 is labeled 1, detailed as 3M7K_1|Chain A|restriction endonuclease PacI|Pseudomonas alcaligenes (43263), and its label confirms its classification as 1; its amino acid sequence is MTQCPRCQRNLAADEFYAGSSKMCKGCMTWQNLSYNANKEGHANTFTKATFLAWYGLSAQRHCGYCGISEAGFTSLHRTNPRGYHIQCLGVDRSDSFEGYSPQNARLACFICNRIKSNIFSASEMDVLGEAISKAWHGRGIA. This indicates a protein identified as a restriction endonuclease from *Pseudomonas alcaligenes*, belonging to class 1.\n\n**Protein_9460:**  Protein_9460, labeled 0, is detailed as NESG-XcR171, work stopped, and the label confirms its class as 0; its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is MSVIDANALDTAAFVARYRALFEHSPWVVERAARRRPFDDVFGGLMQVVYDASPDDQLALIRAHPELAGKAAIDRTLTAASAAEQASAGLDRLDEDEFHRFHALNHAYRQRFGFPFVICVRLQDKAGILAELQRRLDAPRNDEIATALAEIGKIVHLRLEALPLEHHHHHH. Similar to protein_64551, this protein is from a project that was stopped and belongs to class 0.\n\n**Protein_11151:** The protein, protein_11151, is labeled 0, detailed as MCSG-APC733, work stopped, and its label confirms its class as 0; its amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is MSGDENKLKKYRFPETLTNQSRWFGLPLDELIPAAICIGWGITTSKYLFGIGAAVLVYFGIKKLKKGRGSSWLRDLIYWYMPTALLRGIFS. This protein also comes from a halted project and is classified as 0.\n\n\n**Protein_6281:** Protein_6281, labeled 0, is detailed as NESG-RnR304, work stopped, and the label confirms its class as 0; its significantly longer amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is MKLSKRPMDQQSSDEDADTDFDTQIIIQQSLLDAYKPELTGRTPEDERSQSFSSEDYKKIVEAIETVKYSSYPRPSKEDALASFAKYHPAFDEANGSGWLPLHKAAVQLNKNILEITLNASKPSAWEQTTRNGETPLFLAVSSSLLENAHFLLLNGCDPNAKNFEGNSPLLTAVLKDSYDMATLLINHGANVNLRCANERTALHEAAKLGRQDMVKLMLSSGANPDARSSYGFTPLALAAQGGHTETMQLLLQKGADVHSQASDSSSVLLEAVRGGDPDSVSLLLEYGADANIPKSSGHLPIHVAADKGHFLALKVLVPVTDIAAIKRSGISPLHCAAAGAHPQCLDLLIRAGFDVNFMLDQRVRKHYDDQRKSALYFAVSNGDLSSVKLLLSAGALPNQDPVNCLQIALRMGNYELINLLLRHGANVNYFCRVNPLHFPSALQYTLKDEVMLRMLLNYGYDTERCFDCPHGERVHRCCTFEGWTSTVIKDTMFCEVITLSWLQHLSGKVVRVMLDYVDQVQICSKLKAVLEKQKLWPEIHVILTNPRSLQHLCRLKIRKCMGRLRLRCPVFMSFLPLPNLLKAYVLYKEYDLYGQGSSTGTR.  This protein also originates from a stopped project and belongs to class 0.\n\n\nIn summary, the data shows five proteins, four of which (protein_64551, protein_9460, protein_11151, and protein_6281) are labeled as 0 and originate from projects where work was stopped.  Only protein_26055 is labeled as 1 and identified as a restriction endonuclease.  The labels seem to be classifying proteins based on some criteria not explicitly defined in this data.\n"
