Each row represents a VHH sequence from an alpaca named Christy, a female,  with the antigen label \"Alpha+E484K_cell\".  The `label` column indicates whether the VHH sequence binds (1) or does not bind (0) to the antigen.  For example, the first row shows a VHH sequence (MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAQVQLQESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGVTLDYYSMAWFRQAPGKEREAVSCISSSGDMTDYVDSVKGRFTISRDNAKNTVYLQMNSLKPEDTAVYYCAGAPTAYASSCPTPADFGSWGQGTQVTVSS) from Christy that does not bind (label: 0) to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.  Similar descriptions apply to the other rows, with variations in the VHH sequence and, in one case, a binding outcome (label:1).  The data suggests Christy produced multiple VHH sequences with varying binding affinities to the Alpha+E484K_cell antigen.\n"
