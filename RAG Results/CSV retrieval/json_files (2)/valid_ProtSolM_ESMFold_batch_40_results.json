This suggests the protein is part of a research project that has been halted.\n\n**protein_27137:** Protein_27137 is labeled 1, identified as 5NJT_51|Chain YA[auth x]|Ribosome hibernation promotion factor|Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 (224308), and has the amino acid sequence MNYNIRGENIEVTPALKDHVERKIGKLERYFDHSVDADVNVNLKFYNDKESKVEVTIPMTDLALRSEVHNEDMYNAIDLATNKLERQIRKHKTKVNRKFREQES.  The label of 1 and its identification as a ribosome hibernation promotion factor from Bacillus subtilis suggest this protein plays a role in bacterial ribosome regulation.\n\n**protein_23735:** Protein_23735 has a label of 0, and details show it's linked to CESG-GO.32629, with a status of \"work stopped,\" a value of 2, and a confirmed label of 0; its amino acid sequence is MSETEFKVLLETFTFPADSAPFKSCHASTIVEVVKDHFLAAYFGGTREGAPDVKIWLQHFKDGQWDSPVIVDEEPGVPMYNPVLFKLPSHELLLFYKIGQEVQKWSGCMKRSYDKGITWTEREQLPPGILGPIKNKPILLEDGTLLCGSSVESWNSWGAWMEVTSDAGRTWRKKGPIYIQGKSLSVIQPVPYQTAAGNLRILLRSFTGIDRICISESLDGGENWSFAVPTVLPNPNSGIDGVKLKDGRLVLAYNTDSRGVLKLGVSLDDGDSWTDILTLEESPGMEYSYPAVIQAGDGNVHVTYTYNRTQIKHVVLKTATDIDSKPYRHGEAGGGHVNLDLYEPNIN.  Similar to protein_24706, this suggests this protein is from a project that has been discontinued.\n\n**protein_53262:**  Protein_53262, labeled 1, is associated with NYSGXRC-10071b, described as \"soluble,\" with a value of 2, and a confirmed label of 1; its amino acid sequence is SLSKIFGLQCIYKPTCSKYSIECLKKYNFLTALILMTLRIIRCNALFKGGNDFTPKYKPILESLKEFKKRLIK. The label of 1 and description of \"soluble\" suggest this protein is likely a successfully produced and soluble protein.\n\n**protein_64046:** Protein_64046 has a label of 0, associated with NESG-YT737, a status of \"work stopped,\" a value of 1, and a confirmed label of 0.  Its amino acid sequence is MSVNFFSLITSSWERGLFLKSCKNNSGTDSNRFFSFSVPPNLLDNLLPPLLVRKTLSSSSSKSCGIGGIYFKSSAVNVSEDGLTASTFFSILLPKNFLGITKLFCRIFLLSCPHNYKWFIHLINPFEYENFINIE.  This protein, like others with label 0, appears to be from a research project that has been terminated.\n"
