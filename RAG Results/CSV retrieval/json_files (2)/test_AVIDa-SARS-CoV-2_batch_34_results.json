Each row represents a VHH sequence from an alpaca named Christy, female, and  the VHH sequence's interaction with an Alpha+E484K cell antigen, resulting in a label of 0.  There is no variation in subject information across the rows.  The VHH sequences themselves differ, suggesting different antibody responses.  A true analysis requires a CSV format to allow for more sophisticated analysis and summarization.\n"
