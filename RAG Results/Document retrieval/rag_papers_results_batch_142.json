Designing reasonable proteins with desired functions is crucial. A protein\u2019s sequence and structure are strongly correlated and they together determine its function. This paper proposes NAEPro, a model to jointly design Protein sequence and structure based on automatically detected functional and conserved sites. NAEPro is powered by an interleaving network of attention and equivariant layers, which can capture global correlation in a whole sequence and local influence from nearest amino acids in three-dimensional (3D) space.  The model is evaluated on \u03b2-lactamase and myoglobin datasets, showing high binding affinity scores.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to co-design protein sequence and 3D structure simultaneously, guided by automatically identified functional motifs (meaningful fragments). The hypothesis is that leveraging these functionally important sites will lead to the design of proteins with higher binding affinity and more consistent structures.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** NAEPro, using stacked NAELs (Neighborhood Attentive Equivariant Layers), achieved the highest binding affinity scores among several baselines on \u03b2-lactamase and myoglobin datasets.  Analysis showed the model's ability to generate novel proteins with high binding potential to their target metallocofactors and high structural similarity to natural proteins.  NAEPro is also significantly faster than compared methods.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Inferring interaction partners from protein sequences**\n\n1. **Title:** Inferring interaction partners from protein sequences\n\n2. **Abstract:** Specific protein-protein interactions are crucial in the cell. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interaction partners, causing their sequences to be correlated. This paper introduces an iterative algorithm (IPA) to predict specific interaction partners from two protein families whose members are known to interact. The algorithm's performance is assessed on histidine kinases and response regulators, and then applied to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter complexes.  Two metrics are presented to distinguish interacting from non-interacting protein families using only sequence data.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to predict specific protein-protein interaction partners using only sequence data, exploiting the co-evolutionary signals present in the sequences of interacting proteins. The hypothesis is that strong correlations between the amino acid sequences of interacting proteins reflect functional constraints and can be used to accurately identify interaction partners.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The IPA achieved a high true positive fraction (0.93) in predicting histidine kinase-response regulator pairs, even without any prior knowledge of interaction partners.  The success is attributed to the preferential recruitment of correct pairs due to sequence similarity and an \"Anna Karenina effect\" where correct pairs are more similar to each other than incorrect pairs. The method also successfully predicted interactions in ABC transporter complexes and provided metrics to distinguish interacting from non-interacting protein families based solely on sequence data.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Structure and kinetics of chemically cross-linked protein gels from small-angle X-ray scattering**\n\n1. **Title:** Structure and kinetics of chemically cross-linked protein gels from small-angle X-ray scattering\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-links proteins, forming gels. This paper uses small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterize the microstructure and structural kinetics of gels formed by cross-linking pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, myoglobin, or intestinal fatty acid-binding protein.  The goal is to understand the gel structure and the kinetics of cross-linking.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the microstructure and cross-linking kinetics of protein gels formed using glutaraldehyde. The hypothesis is that SAXS can provide detailed information about the spatial organization of proteins within the gel and the time-dependent changes during gel formation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** SAXS revealed that the protein gels are spatially heterogeneous, with dense clusters linked by sparse networks.  The native protein structure was largely unaffected by cross-linking.  Cluster size was mainly determined by the availability of lysine amino groups on the protein surface. Gel development followed approximately first-order kinetics, with cross-linking being slower at acidic pH.  These findings support the use of cross-linked protein gels in NMR studies.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Information Rates of Controlled Protein Interactions Using Terahertz Communication**\n\n1. **Title:** Information Rates of Controlled Protein Interactions Using Terahertz Communication\n\n2. **Abstract:** This work presents a model bridging electromagnetic (EM) and molecular communication through stimuli-responsive intra-body interactions.  Terahertz (THz) waves stimulate proteins, inducing conformational changes.  A communication system is formulated with a nanoantenna transmitter and a protein receiver, modeled using Markov chains.  The mutual information and capacity are derived for two-state and multi-state protein models.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to model the interaction between a THz nanoantenna and a protein as a communication channel and quantify the information transmission rate. The hypothesis is that the THz-induced conformational changes in proteins can be used for controlled information transmission, and this process can be analyzed using information-theoretic tools.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The authors derived analytical expressions for the mutual information and computed the channel capacity for both two-state and multi-state protein models under different constraints (e.g., average energy constraint). The results suggest that controlled protein signaling using THz nanoantennas can indeed be used as a communication platform.  The capacity increases with increasing nanoantenna force and depends on the protein's transition rates.  The multi-state model provides a more realistic representation of complex protein signaling pathways.\n\n\n**Paper 5: Decorated Protein Networks: Functional Nanomaterials with Tunable Domain Size**\n\n1. **Title:** Decorated Protein Networks: Functional Nanomaterials with Tunable Domain Size\n\n2. **Abstract:**  (Not provided in excerpt)\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create functional nanomaterials by controlling the self-assembly of proteins into networks with tunable domain sizes. The hypothesis is that by manipulating protein-salt interactions and using surface modifications, it's possible to create decorated protein networks where the domains of different protein species can be controlled, while preserving protein functionality.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Using eGFP and cationized mCherry as a model system, the authors demonstrated that they could create decorated protein networks with distinct domains of each protein.  The size of the protein domains could be tuned by varying the concentration ratio of the proteins.  Importantly, both proteins retained their fluorescence throughout the assembly process, indicating that functionality was preserved.  The results suggest a promising route for creating new types of functional biomaterials.\n",
