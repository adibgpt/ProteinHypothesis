        "response": "Here are summaries of the provided papers, following the requested format.  Note that some sections may be incomplete due to missing information in the excerpts.\n\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** Membrane tubule formation by banana-shaped proteins with or without transient network structure\n\n2. **Abstract:**  In living cells, membrane morphology is regulated by various proteins, many containing a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain. This paper investigates the role of BAR protein rods in inducing membrane tubulation using large-scale coarse-grained simulations.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that the spontaneous side curvature (perpendicular to the long axis) of banana-shaped BAR domain proteins significantly alters membrane tubulation dynamics, particularly at high protein density.  The authors hypothesize that protein-protein and membrane-protein interactions generate this side curvature, influencing tubule formation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Simulations showed that a small spontaneous side curvature drastically alters tubulation dynamics at high protein density, but not at low density.  A percolated network intermediately forms, depending on the side curvature. This network suppresses tubule protrusion, leading to slower formation of fewer tubules. Positive surface tensions and vesicle membrane curvature can stabilize this network structure, suppressing tubulation.  Geometric analysis supports the finding that negative side curvature stabilizes the branched network.  The original membrane curvature of small vesicles also alters tubulation dynamics.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Physical limits to membrane curvature sensing by a single protein\n\n2. **Abstract:** Recent experiments show a single septin protein can distinguish between membrane curvatures on micron-scale beads. This paper investigates whether a protein can sense micron-scale curvature by measuring local membrane curvature or bilayer lipid densities, accounting for thermal fluctuations.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to determine the physical limits to a protein's ability to sense micron-scale membrane curvature, considering the noise introduced by thermal membrane fluctuations. The hypothesis is that the precision of curvature sensing is limited by the protein size, membrane properties, and the strength of membrane-substrate adhesion.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Analytical and simulation results (using developed algorithms to simulate lipid density and membrane shape fluctuations) show that curvature fluctuations sensed by a protein are large relative to the average curvature, making sensing difficult. Membrane-bead adhesion suppresses fluctuations, improving sensing. Measuring lipid density deviations is a good proxy for curvature sensing, especially for small proteins or thick membranes. Two models (preferred curvature and curvature threshold) are developed to explain experimental protein-bead association rates. The experimentally observed septin sensing is close to the theoretical limits.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein Structure Determination Using Chemical Shifts\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided, but implied from the introduction and contents) This dissertation explores the use of chemical shift data in protein structure determination, focusing on developing improved methods for incorporating this data into simulations, and creating more accurate chemical shift prediction tools.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The central hypothesis is that by combining accurate chemical shift prediction with advanced Monte Carlo sampling techniques, protein structures can be determined efficiently and accurately, even for larger proteins where traditional methods struggle.  This involves developing a Bayesian framework for integrating experimental chemical shift data with physical energy terms.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The author presents a Bayesian framework for incorporating chemical shifts into protein structure determination. Gaussian and Cauchy error models are explored for representing the uncertainty in chemical shift prediction.  Simulations using these models show that sampling from a biased distribution (TorusDBN-CS) and using a Cauchy error model with fixed weights significantly improve sampling and scoring compared to other approaches. A new chemical shift predictor (ProCS) is developed using quantum mechanical calculations.  The ProCS predictor is faster than existing methods and produces structures with improved hydrogen bonding geometries.  The author demonstrates successful structure determination for several small proteins and makes progress on larger proteins using a combination of chemical shifts and sparse NOE data.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** DeepSymmetry: Using 3D convolutional networks for identification of tandem repeats and internal symmetries in protein structures\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper presents DeepSymmetry, a method using 3D convolutional neural networks to detect structural repetitions in proteins and their density maps.  The method identifies tandem repeat proteins, internal symmetries, symmetry order, and axes.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that 3D convolutional neural networks can effectively learn to identify patterns of structural repetition (tandem repeats and internal symmetries) directly from volumetric density maps of proteins.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** DeepSymmetry successfully identifies tandem repeat proteins, symmetry order, and symmetry axes with high accuracy (82% for symmetry order and < 2\u00b0 angular error for axes in many cases). It performs well compared to other methods on a benchmark dataset, even without using sequence or secondary structure information.  A large-scale analysis of the PDB identified over 10,000 putative tandem repeat proteins not in RepeatsDB. The method also shows promise for identifying symmetries in low-resolution cryo-EM density maps.  The use of a 6D Veronese mapping is crucial for robust axis prediction.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** Interactions between Membrane Inclusions on Fluctuating Membranes\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper models membrane proteins as anisotropic objects and determines the coupling between order parameters and membrane curvature.  It considers interactions between transmembrane proteins (with and without reflection symmetry), and non-transmembrane proteins.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that the interactions between membrane inclusions are mediated by the fluctuating membrane itself, and that the strength and anisotropy of these interactions depend on the shape and symmetry properties of the inclusions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Using a field theoretic approach, the authors find 1/R\u2074 interactions between transmembrane proteins, with the strength depending on whether reflection symmetry is broken and the cross-sectional shape of the proteins.  Anisotropic interactions are found for non-circular cross-sections.  Non-transmembrane proteins show non-entropic 1/R\u2074 many-particle interactions.  For large R, these interactions are larger than Van der Waals or screened electrostatic interactions, potentially dominating protein aggregation.  The authors recover and extend previous results on circular inclusions.\n",
