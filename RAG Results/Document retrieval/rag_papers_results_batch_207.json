Note that some sections might be incomplete due to missing information in the provided text.\n\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** How natural sequence variation modulates protein folding dynamics\n\n2. **Abstract:** Natural protein sequences serve as a natural record of the evolutionary constraints that shape their functional structures. We show that it is possible to use sequence information to go beyond predicting native structures and global stability to infer the folding dynamics of globular proteins. ... We show that protein topology imposes limits on the variability of folding cooperativity within a family. ... We show that both the stability and cooperativity changes induced by mutations can be computed directly using sequence-based evolutionary models.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate how natural sequence variations within protein families affect their folding dynamics, using evolutionary information to inform a coarse-grained folding model. The hypothesis is that the relationship between evolutionary energy and folding dynamics can be quantified, allowing prediction of folding stability and cooperativity changes upon mutations.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  A coarse-grained Ising model, informed by evolutionary data (Restricted Boltzmann Machine), was used to simulate the folding of 7500 proteins from 15 families.  The study found that protein topology constrains cooperativity variability; alpha structures show more diverse folding mechanisms than beta or alpha/beta structures.  A strong correlation was found between folding temperature and evolutionary energy.  Importantly, the model allows prediction of the effects of single-site mutations on both folding temperature and cooperativity without further simulations.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein structure, activity and thermal stability within nanoscopic compartments\n\n2. **Abstract:**  We report that protein confinement within nanoscopic vesicular compartments corresponds to a liquid-liquid phase transition with the protein/water within vesicle lumen interacting very differently than in bulk. We show this effect leads to considerable structural changes on the proteins with evidence suggesting non-alpha helical conformations. Most importantly both aspects lead to a significant improvement on protein stability against thermal denaturation up to 95\u00baC at neutral pH, with little or no evidence of unfolding or reduced enzymatic activity. ... Our results suggest that nanoscopic confinement is a promising new avenue for the enhanced long-term storage of proteins.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the effects of nanoscale confinement within polymersomes on protein structure, stability, and activity. The hypothesis is that confinement within polymersomes will significantly enhance protein stability against thermal denaturation and potentially alter protein structure.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Myoglobin encapsulated in PMPC-PDPA polymersomes showed significantly enhanced thermal stability up to 95\u00b0C at neutral pH, with no apparent unfolding detected by UV-Vis or fluorescence spectroscopy. Circular dichroism suggested structural changes, potentially involving 310-helices and polyproline II helices.  Enzymatic activity was not only preserved but even increased in some cases after thermal cycling.  The results suggest that nanoscale confinement provides a promising method for long-term protein storage and has implications for understanding the origin of life.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Network measures for protein folding state discrimination\n\n2. **Abstract:** Proteins fold using a two-state or multi-state kinetic mechanisms, but up to now there isn\u2019t a \ufb01rst-principle model to explain this different behaviour. We exploit the network properties of protein structures by introducing novel observables to address the problem of classifying the different types of folding kinetics. ... The relevance of these observables is supported by a classification performance up to 90%, even with simple classifiers such as discriminant analysis.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop novel network-based observables derived from protein contact maps to classify proteins into two-state (TS) and multi-state (MS) folding categories. The hypothesis is that network properties of the native protein structure reflect information about the folding kinetics, with MS proteins exhibiting different network characteristics compared to TS proteins.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Three new network observables were introduced: a network entropy ratio (SR), Laplacian-based eigenvalues (\u03bbi), and inter-residue link density (R0).  Using these features with Fisher Discriminant Analysis, the study achieved up to 88% classification accuracy (and 90.48% without cross-validation) in distinguishing between TS and MS proteins.  The combination of \u03bbN\u22121 and R0 provided the best performance.  The results suggest that these network observables capture essential information about protein folding mechanisms.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** A topological selection of folding pathways from native states of knotted proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:** Understanding the biological function of knots in proteins and their folding process is an open and challenging question in biology. ... We approach the analysis of proteins with the same topology by introducing a topologically inspired statistical metric between their knotoid distributions. ... By looking directly at the geometry and topology of their native states, we are able to probe different folding pathways for proteins forming open-ended trefoil knots. ... Our pipeline reveals that the folding pathway of shallow knotted Carbonic Anhydrases involves the creation of a double-looped structure, differently from what was previously observed for deeply knotted trefoil proteins. We validate this with Molecular Dynamics simulations.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the folding pathways of knotted proteins by analyzing their native states using a novel topological metric, KnotoEMD. The hypothesis is that the geometry and topology of the native state, captured by the knotoid distribution, can reveal information about the folding pathway, distinguishing between different mechanisms (single-loop vs. double-loop).\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  KnotoEMD, a metric based on earth mover's distance between knotoid distributions, was used to analyze trefoil knotted proteins.  The results showed that KnotoEMD effectively clusters proteins by sequence similarity and distinguishes between different geometric features of open trefoils.  The study suggests that shallow knotted Carbonic Anhydrases likely follow a double-loop folding pathway, unlike deeply knotted proteins which appear to follow a single-loop mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the double-loop hypothesis for Carbonic Anhydrase 4QEF.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** Dipole-dipole interactions in protein-protein complexes: a quantum mechanical study of the ubiquitin-Dsk2 complex\n\n2. **Abstract:** Quantum mechanical calculations are performed on the proteins that constitute the ubiquitin-Dsk2 complex whose atomic structure has been experimentally determined by NMR spectroscopy (PDB id 1WR1). The results indicate that the dipole moment vectors of the two proteins are aligned in a head-to-tail orientation while forming an angle of ~130\u00b0. Hence, attractive dipole-dipole interactions not only stabilize the protein-protein complex but they are likely to favor the correct orientation of the proteins during the formation of the complex.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the role of dipole-dipole interactions in the stability and formation of the ubiquitin-Dsk2 protein complex using quantum mechanical calculations. The hypothesis is that attractive dipole-dipole interactions between ubiquitin and Dsk2 contribute significantly to the stability of the complex and influence the proteins' relative orientation during complex formation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Quantum mechanical calculations using MOPAC2009 showed that the dipole moment vectors of ubiquitin and Dsk2 in their complex are aligned in a head-to-tail orientation (~130\u00b0 angle). This indicates attractive dipole-dipole interactions that stabilize the complex and may guide the proteins into their correct orientation during complex formation.\n",
