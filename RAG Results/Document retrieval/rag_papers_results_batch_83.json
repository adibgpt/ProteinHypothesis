Identifying Orientation-specific Lipid-protein Fingerprints using Deep Learning.**\n\n1. **Title:** Identifying Orientation-specific Lipid-protein Fingerprints using Deep Learning.\n2. **Abstract:** Improved understanding of the relation between the behavior of RAS and RAF proteins and the local lipid environment in the cell membrane is critical for getting insights into the mechanisms underlying cancer formation. In this work, we employ deep learning (DL) to learn this relationship by predicting protein orientational states of RAS and RAS-RAF protein complexes with respect to the lipid membrane based on the lipid densities around the protein domains from coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our DL model can predict six protein states with an overall accuracy of over 80%. The findings of this work offer new insights into how the proteins modulate the lipid environment, which in turn may assist designing novel therapies to regulate such interactions in the mechanisms associated with cancer development.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The hypothesis is that unique spatial distributions of lipids around RAS and RAS-RAF proteins (lipid fingerprints) are associated with specific protein orientations relative to the cell membrane, and these fingerprints can be learned by a deep learning model to predict protein states.\n4. **Summary of Results:** A deep learning model achieved >80% accuracy in predicting six protein orientational states based on lipid fingerprints from molecular dynamics simulations.  The model revealed relationships between specific lipid types and protein orientations, potentially informing therapeutic design.\n\n\n**12.  Persistent homology analysis of protein structure, flexibility and folding.**\n\n1. **Title:** Persistent homology analysis of protein structure, flexibility and folding.\n2. **Abstract:** Proteins are the most important biomolecules for living organisms. The understanding of protein structure, function, dynamics and transport is one of most challenging tasks in biological science. In the present work, persistent homology is, for the first time, introduced for extracting molecular topological fingerprints (MTFs) based on the persistence of molecular topological invariants. MTFs are utilized for protein characterization, identification and classification. The method of slicing is proposed to track the geometric origin of protein topological invariants. Both all-atom and coarse-grained representations of MTFs are constructed. A new cutoff-like filtration is proposed to shed light on the optimal cutoff distance in elastic network models. Based on the correlation between protein compactness, rigidity and connectivity, we propose an accumulated bar length generated from persistent topological invariants for the quantitative modeling of protein flexibility. To this end, a correlation matrix based filtration is developed. This approach gives rise to an accurate prediction of the optimal characteristic distance used in protein B-factor analysis. Finally, MTFs are employed to characterize protein topological evolution during protein folding and quantitatively predict the protein folding stability. An excellent consistency between our persistent homology prediction and molecular dynamics simulation is found. This work reveals the topology-function relationship of proteins.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that persistent homology can be used to extract meaningful topological features (molecular topological fingerprints, MTFs) from protein structures, which can then be used to characterize, identify, and classify proteins and predict their flexibility and folding stability.\n4. **Summary of Results:** Persistent homology successfully extracted MTFs from protein structures, revealing topological features related to secondary structure elements (alpha-helices, beta-sheets).  A new filtration method was used to determine optimal cutoff distances in elastic network models for flexibility analysis.  Accumulated bar lengths from persistent homology were correlated with protein flexibility and folding stability, showing good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations.\n\n\n**13. InstructProtein: A Large Language Model for Bidirectional Protein Language Generation.**\n\n1. **Title:** InstructProtein: A Large Language Model for Bidirectional Protein Language Generation.\n2. **Abstract:** Not fully provided in excerpt.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a large language model (LLM) capable of bidirectional generation between human language and protein language.

It also demonstrated the ability to generate protein sequences consistent with structural and functional instructions, showing promising results in protein de novo design.

EGR: Equivariant Graph Refinement and Assessment of 3D Protein Complex Structures.**\n\n1. **Title:** EGR: Equivariant Graph Refinement and Assessment of 3D Protein Complex Structures.\n2. **Abstract:** Protein complexes are macromolecules essential to the functioning and well-being of all living organisms. As the structure of a protein complex, in particular its region of interaction between multiple protein subunits (i.e., chains), has a notable influence on the biological function of the complex, computational methods that can quickly and effectively be used to refine and assess the quality of a protein complex\u2019s 3D structure can directly be used within a drug discovery pipeline to accelerate the development of new therapeutics and improve the efficacy of future vaccines. In this work, we introduce the Equivariant Graph Re\ufb01ner (EGR), a novel E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) for multi-task structure refinement and assessment of protein complexes. Our experiments on new, diverse protein complex datasets, all of which we make publicly available in this work, demonstrate the state-of-the-art effectiveness of EGR for atomistic refinement and assessment of protein complexes and outline directions for future work in the field. In doing so, we establish a baseline for future studies in macromolecular refinement and structure analysis.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) can effectively refine the 3D structures of protein complexes and simultaneously assess their quality, outperforming existing methods.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The EGR model achieved state-of-the-art performance in all-atom refinement and quality assessment of protein complexes on new benchmark datasets.  Ablation studies showed the importance of different input features.  The method is significantly faster than traditional refinement methods.\n\n\n",
