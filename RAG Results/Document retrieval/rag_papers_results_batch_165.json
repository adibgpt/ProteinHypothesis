Note that some papers lack abstracts, and the level of detail in the excerpts varies, limiting the completeness of some summaries.\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** Cysteine post-translational modifications: ten years from chemical proteomics to bioinformatics\n\n2. **Abstract:** As the only thiol-bearing amino acid, cysteine (Cys) residues in proteins have the reactive thiol side chain, which is susceptible to a series of post-translational modifications (PTMs). These PTMs participate in a wide range of biological activities including the alteration of enzymatic reactions, protein-protein interactions and protein stability. Here we summarize the advance of cysteine PTM identification technologies and the features of the various kinds of the PTMs. We also discuss in silico approaches for the prediction of the different types of cysteine modified sites, giving directions for future study.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper reviews the progress made in understanding cysteine post-translational modifications (PTMs) over the past decade, focusing on advancements in chemical proteomics, and bioinformatics prediction tools.  The underlying hypothesis is that improved technologies will reveal the crucial roles of cysteine PTMs in various biological processes and diseases.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The review details four strategies for enriching cysteine PTMs: thiol blocking, direct capture, metabolic labeling with bioorthogonal chemistry, and thiol isotope labeling.  It then comprehensively discusses various cysteine PTMs (oxidation, lipidation, and metabolite modifications), including their identification techniques, biological roles, and associated diseases. The review also summarizes the development of bioinformatics tools for predicting cysteine modification sites, emphasizing the use of machine learning algorithms and various sequence feature encoding methods. Finally, it highlights the crosstalk between different cysteine PTMs and suggests future research directions, including developing more sensitive and efficient identification techniques and prediction tools.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** The effect of stereochemical constraints on the radius of gyration of folded proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Not provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper aims to determine the minimal physical features required for a coarse-grained protein model to accurately reproduce the radius of gyration (Rg) scaling observed in real proteins.  The hypothesis is that specific stereochemical constraints, along with side chain representation, are crucial for accurate Rg(n) scaling and other structural properties of folded proteins.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study uses four coarse-grained protein models of increasing complexity:  a freely-jointed chain, a chain with bend and dihedral angle constraints, a chain with added side chains of random size, and a chain with sequence-specific side chain sizes.  The results show that only the model with sequence-specific side chain sizes and bend/dihedral constraints accurately recapitulates the anomalous Rg(n) scaling observed in a large dataset of x-ray crystal structures of proteins. This model also correctly predicts the average packing fraction and size of the protein core.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Oligomers of heat-shock proteins: Structures that don\u2019t imply function\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the role of passive molecular chaperones, such as small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs), in preventing protein aggregation. The hypothesis is that the primary function of these chaperones is to increase the overall solubility of the proteome, and that oligomerization is a secondary effect, not necessarily crucial for their function.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Using a lattice model of interacting proteins, the simulations demonstrate that chaperones enhance the thermodynamic stability of protein solutions by increasing the solubility of the proteome.  Surprisingly, the optimal chaperone-client binding strength, which balances solubility and reversible binding, also promotes the formation of chaperone oligomers. However, the simulations suggest that these oligomers do not significantly affect the thermodynamic stability of the solution, implying that oligomerization might be a byproduct of optimizing proteome solubility rather than a primary functional aspect.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Asymmetric environment induces protein-like relaxation in spin chain\n\n2. **Abstract:** Proteins are aminoacid chains that diffusively fold or unfold depending on the thermal and chemical environmental conditions. While sophisticated models account for detailed aspects of real proteins, finding traits that unify protein dynamics to general open chains relaxation is still challenging. The principle of minimal frustration represents a key step towards this goal, revealing a fundamental link between proteins and spin glasses. Here, we search for the emergence of protein-like relaxation in open spin chains by going beyond the validity domain of the minimal frustration principle as to focus on the role of system-environment interactions rather than on frustration in the system\u2019s Hamiltonian. We find that strong asymmetries between the couplings of each spin to its immediate surroundings imply close similarities to protein folding and unfolding dynamics. Namely, an asymmetric bath can (i) block the system from finding its minimum energy state, even in the complete absence of energetic frustration in the system\u2019s Hamiltonian, and (ii) excite the system resembling the well-known distinction between thermal and chemical denaturations.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper explores the emergence of protein-like relaxation dynamics in open quantum spin chains, focusing on the role of asymmetric system-environment interactions rather than internal frustration. The hypothesis is that strong asymmetries in the coupling of spins to their environment can mimic key aspects of protein folding and unfolding, including the blocking of the lowest energy state and distinct responses to thermal and chemical perturbations.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The authors derive a Markovian quantum master equation for a spin chain coupled to multiple independent reservoirs. They demonstrate that asymmetric couplings between the spins and their environments can (i) prevent the system from reaching its ground state, even without internal frustration, and (ii) induce distinct excitation pathways analogous to thermal and chemical denaturation in proteins.  This is illustrated using an Ising model of two spins, showing that varying temperature or coupling strength leads to different excitation probabilities, mirroring experimental observations of protein denaturation.  The results suggest a fundamental connection between asymmetric system-bath interactions and protein-like relaxation dynamics.\n",
