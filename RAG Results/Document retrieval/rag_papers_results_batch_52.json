Note that some sections may be incomplete due to missing information in the provided excerpts.\n\n**Paper 1: UNIFYING SEQUENCES, STRUCTURES, AND DESCRIPTIONS FOR ANY-TO-ANY PROTEIN GENERATION WITH THE LARGE MULTIMODAL MODEL HELIXPROTX**\n\n1. **Title:** UNIFYING SEQUENCES, STRUCTURES, AND DESCRIPTIONS FOR ANY-TO-ANY PROTEIN GENERATION WITH THE LARGE MULTIMODAL MODEL HELIXPROTX\n\n2. **Abstract:** Current protein research methodologies focus on limited specialized tasks, often predicting one protein modality (sequence, structure, description) from another.  This paper introduces HelixProtX, a system built upon a large multimodal model, aiming to offer a comprehensive solution by supporting any-to-any protein modality generation.  Experimental results show HelixProtX outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across a range of protein-related tasks.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The hypothesis is that integrating large multimodal models with any-to-any generation capabilities into protein research will significantly improve the efficiency and comprehensiveness of protein studies.  This is based on the success of large multimodal models in other domains.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** HelixProtX demonstrates superior accuracy in generating functional descriptions from sequences and structures, and in designing sequences and structures from textual descriptions.  It consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across various tasks, showing robustness across proteins of varying lengths and families. The system's ability to unify sequence, structure, and description modalities streamlines protein research.  Joint training of multiple tasks within a unified model improves accuracy compared to task-specific training.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Investigations on the electrical current-voltage response in protein light receptors**\n\n1. **Title:** Investigations on the electrical current-voltage response in protein light receptors\n\n2. **Abstract:** A theoretical/computational approach for modeling the current-voltage characteristics of sensing proteins is presented. The modeling is applied to bacteriorhodopsin and proteorhodopsin, revealing a tunneling charge-transfer mechanism. Agreement between theory and experiments provides a microscopic interpretation of charge transfer in proteins.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a microscopic model of charge transport in transmembrane proteins (TMPs) like bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and proteorhodopsin (pR), based on an impedance network analogy.  The hypothesis is that charge transfer through the amino acids is the main transport mechanism, explaining the observed super-linear current-voltage characteristics.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The impedance network protein analogous (INPA) model accurately reproduces experimental current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for bR and pR, revealing a transition between direct tunneling and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling regimes.  Conductance fluctuations follow a generalized Gumbel distribution, indicating a non-Gaussian behavior due to conductance bounds. The model predicts pR behavior in a voltage range not yet experimentally explored.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Protein Synthesis- Degradation, A Stochastic Approach-part I**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein Synthesis- Degradation, A Stochastic Approach-part I\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper studies protein synthesis-degradation as a continuous-time birth-death Markov process. Using generating function techniques, an exact calculation method for the joint probability distribution of protein copies is presented for a two-dimensional birth-death process with interaction.  Exact solutions are found in the steady state for a particular choice of transition rules.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a stochastic model of protein synthesis and degradation, considering the inherent fluctuations in biochemical processes, will provide valuable analytical insights.  The model specifically focuses on the interaction between two protein types, where the production rate of one type depends on the copy number of the other.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  An analytical expression for the joint probability distribution of two protein types (one with a discrete, large state space and the other with only two states) is derived in the steady state using generating function techniques.  The marginal distribution of protein type 1 is a Poisson distribution, reflecting its independence from protein type 2. The results provide a framework for understanding the stochastic dynamics of interacting protein populations.\n\n\n**Paper 4: A many\u2013body term improves the accuracy of e\ufb00ective potentials based on protein coevolutionary data**\n\n1. **Title:** A many\u2013body term improves the accuracy of e\ufb00ective potentials based on protein coevolutionary data\n\n2. **Abstract:**  This paper extends a two-body effective potential for proteins by introducing a many-body term based on maximum entropy principles. The extended potential improves the prediction of the energetic effect of mutations in proteins compared to the two-body potential. The many-body term correlates with residue hydrophobicity, suggesting it partially reflects solvent effects.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that including a many-body term in the effective potential, derived from co-evolutionary data, will improve the accuracy of predicting the energetic effects of mutations. This is based on the idea that solvent effects and other higher-order interactions are not fully captured by two-body terms.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The extended potential, including the many-body term, shows a significantly improved correlation (r=0.77) between calculated and experimental \u2206\u2206G values for 308 mutations in 14 proteins compared to the two-body potential alone (r=0.47).  The many-body term's parameters correlate with residue hydrophobicity, suggesting it reflects solvent effects.  The model performs well even for membrane proteins, using a different reference state.\n\n\n**Paper 5: DESIGN OF LIGAND-BINDING PROTEINS WITH ATOMIC FLOW MATCHING**\n\n1. **Title:** DESIGN OF LIGAND-BINDING PROTEINS WITH ATOMIC FLOW MATCHING\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper introduces ATOMFLOW, a deep generative model using flow matching to design ligand-binding proteins from 2D molecular graphs, considering ligand flexibility.  ATOMFLOW represents proteins and molecules as unified biotokens and iteratively generates ligand conformations and protein structures.  It achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models without requiring known bound ligand structures.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a flow-matching model operating on unified biotoken representations of proteins and ligands will effectively design ligand-binding proteins, accurately capturing ligand flexibility and achieving high binding affinity without requiring pre-knowledge of the bound ligand conformation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** ATOMFLOW generates high-fidelity ligand-binding proteins with performance comparable to RFDiffusionAA, even without requiring a fixed bound ligand structure.  It shows good self-consistency, binding affinity, diversity, and novelty in designed structures.  ATOMFLOW outperforms RFDiffusionAA when the bound ligand conformer is unknown, highlighting its advantage in flexible ligand scenarios.\n",
