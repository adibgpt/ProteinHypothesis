There's debate on whether proteins promote or destroy water's structural order in their hydration shell. This paper uses all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of lysozyme and a new structural descriptor to analyze hydrogen bond structure.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the effect of proteins on the structural order of hydration water. The hypothesis is that proteins promote local structural ordering of hydration water, but have a negligible effect on the strength of individual hydrogen bonds.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Simulations showed that lysozyme promotes local structural ordering of hydration water, increasing the average value of a new structural descriptor \u03b6 by 42%.  The protein's effect is attributed to reorganization of the hydrogen bond network rather than changes in individual hydrogen bond strength.  The structural ordering is heterogeneous across the protein surface.\n\n\n**Paper 20:**\n\n1. **Title:** Contact Order Dependent Protein Folding Rates: Kinetic Consequences of a Cooperative Interplay Between Favorable Nonlocal Interactions and Local Conformational Preferences\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper investigates the correlation between contact order (CO) and protein folding rates.  It uses 3D lattice protein models to evaluate interaction schemes, focusing on the interplay between nonlocal interactions and local conformational preferences.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to understand the physical mechanisms underlying the correlation between contact order (CO) and protein folding rates.  The hypothesis is that this correlation arises from a positive coupling between the favorability of nonlocal contacts and the adoption of native-like conformations in local segments of the protein chain.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  A model incorporating many-body interactions where contact energies become more favorable when adjacent chain segments adopt native-like conformations showed a strong logarithmic correlation (r = 0.914) between CO and folding rates, spanning 2.5 orders of magnitude. This contrasts with G\u014d models with additive contact energies, which showed much weaker correlations.  The model also exhibited calorimetric cooperativity and linear chevron plots, consistent with experimental observations of simple two-state folding kinetics.\n\n\n**Paper 21:**\n\n1. **Title:** On the performance of combined dichotomic predictors of natively unfolded proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper revisits ab initio methods for identifying natively unfolded proteins. It evaluates single predictors and combined scores, comparing their performance to existing methods.  It uses a dataset of folded and natively unfolded proteins.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve the accuracy of predicting natively unfolded proteins using a combination of different prediction methods. The hypothesis is that combining multiple predictors will improve the overall accuracy compared to using any single predictor alone.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The study found that individual predictors (mean packing, mean pairwise energy, and gVSL2) performed comparably to or better than other methods.  Combining predictors did not significantly improve performance, suggesting that different predictors may classify the same sequences differently. A strictly unanimous combination score (SSU) was introduced, which improved performance by leaving sequences with ambiguous folding signatures unclassified.  The study also found a scaling law relating the number of predicted disordered proteins to the total number of proteins in a genome.\n\n\n\n**Paper 22:**\n\n1. **Title:** PUB-MS \u2013 a mass-spectrometry\u2013based method to monitor protein-protein proximity in vivo\n\n2. **Abstract:** Current methods for studying protein-protein proximity in vivo are not well-suited for mass spectrometry-based proteomics labs.  This paper introduces PUB-MS, which uses biotinylation of a protein fused to a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) by a biotin ligase (BirA) fused to its interaction partner. Biotinylation is detected by Western blot or mass spectrometry.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a mass spectrometry-based method for monitoring protein-protein proximity in vivo. The hypothesis is that proximity-dependent biotinylation of a BAP-tagged protein by a BirA-tagged interaction partner will allow for quantitative measurement of proximity using mass spectrometry.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** PUB-MS successfully detected protein proximity in various experimental models, showing enhanced biotinylation when proteins were close. Mass spectrometry enabled multiplexing (using different BAP sequences) and stable isotope labeling.  The method was also used to study protein fate after proximity with another protein, adding a kinetic dimension to the analysis.  The method is sensitive to both short-range proximity and colocalization within cellular compartments.\n",
