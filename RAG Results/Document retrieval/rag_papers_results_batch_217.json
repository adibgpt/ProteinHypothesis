The function of the protein correlates with its structure, emphasizing the need for understanding protein folding for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that occur within biological systems. This work developed a novel turn-based encoding algorithm that can be run on a gate-based quantum computer for predicting the structure of smaller protein sequences using the HP (Hydrophobic and Polar bead) model.  The folding problem is cast in a 3D cubic lattice. The optimization problem is brought down to a second-order formulation (QUBO). Results are compared with classical simulated annealing algorithms and IBM CPLEX.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a quantum algorithm to solve the protein folding problem more efficiently than classical methods. The hypothesis is that a turn-based encoding approach in a 3D cubic lattice,  modified to a QUBO formulation, will allow for efficient computation of protein folding on quantum computers and provide better results than classical approaches for smaller protein sequences.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A turn-based encoding algorithm was developed and implemented on IBM quantum simulators and hardware, along with classical algorithms (simulated annealing and CPLEX). Results showed that the quantum algorithms performed better than classical methods, particularly when sequences had fewer contacts or many adjacent hydrophobic beads.  The hydrophobic collapse, a key feature of protein folding, was captured in both quantum and classical simulations.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Globular bundles and entangled network of proteins (CorA) by a coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulation**\n\n1. **Title:** Globular bundles and entangled network of proteins (CorA) by a coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulation\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Using a coarse-grained model, self-organized assembly of proteins (CorA and its inner segment iCorA) is studied by examining quantities such as contact profile, radius of gyration, and structure factor as a function of protein concentration at a range of low (native phase) to high (denatured phase) temperatures.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the self-organized structures of the CorA protein and its inner segments (iCorA) using coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations. The hypothesis is that the protein-protein interactions, particularly those involving the inner segments, will significantly influence the morphology and stability of the protein assemblies at different temperatures and concentrations.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Simulations revealed distinct morphologies ranging from isolated globular bundles to entangled networks depending on temperature and protein concentration.  At low temperatures (native phase), the radius of gyration of CorA showed little variation with concentration, while iCorA\u2019s radius of gyration increased systematically. At high temperatures (denatured phase), CorA\u2019s radius of gyration increased significantly due to entanglement, while iCorA\u2019s remained relatively constant.  Structure factor analysis showed that iCorA maintained a globular morphology (D~3) across length scales in the native phase, while CorA exhibited a more sparsely distributed morphology (D \u22642) due to entanglement, except in crowded environments at low temperatures (D~2.6).  Stronger protein-protein interactions within iCorA were suggested to contribute to its stable self-assembly.\n\n\n**Paper 3: PGR: A Graph Repository of Protein 3D-Structures**\n\n1. **Title:** PGR: A Graph Repository of Protein 3D-Structures\n\n2. **Abstract:**  This paper presents Protein Graph Repository (PGR), a novel database of protein 3D-structures transformed into graphs allowing the use of the large repertoire of graph theory techniques in protein mining.  This repository contains graph representations of all currently known protein 3D-structures described in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PGR also provides an efficient online converter of protein 3D-structures into graphs, biological and graph-based description, pre-computed protein graph attributes and statistics, visualization of each protein graph, as well as a graph-based protein similarity search tool.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a database (PGR) that represents protein 3D structures as graphs to facilitate the application of graph theory and mining techniques to protein analysis. The hypothesis is that representing protein structures as graphs will allow for more efficient and effective analysis of protein structure, topology, and properties compared to traditional methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The PGR database was created, containing graph representations of protein 3D structures from the PDB.  The database includes an online converter, tools for visualization, and a similarity search tool based on graph properties.  A case study demonstrated the accuracy of the similarity search tool in identifying biologically meaningful similar proteins.\n\n\n**Paper 4: TourSynbio: A Multi-Modal Large Model and Agent Framework to Bridge Text and Protein Sequences for Protein Engineering**\n\n1. **Title:** TourSynbio: A Multi-Modal Large Model and Agent Framework to Bridge Text and Protein Sequences for Protein Engineering\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper introduces TourSynbio-7B, a multi-modal large language model for protein engineering that directly processes protein sequences without external encoders. It also introduces TourSynbio-Agent, an agent framework integrating various deep learning models and tools, offering a unified conversational interface.  The system's effectiveness is demonstrated through wet lab case studies on enzyme modification and steroid compound catalysis.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a multi-modal large language model (TourSynbio-7B) that can directly understand and process protein sequences without external encoders, and to integrate this model into an agent framework (TourSynbio-Agent) for efficient protein engineering. The hypothesis is that this approach will improve the efficiency and accuracy of protein engineering tasks compared to traditional methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** TourSynbio-7B outperformed GPT-4 on the ProteinLMBench benchmark.  TourSynbio-Agent, integrating multiple deep learning models, provided a unified conversational interface for various protein engineering tasks. Wet lab case studies demonstrated significant improvements in mutation accuracy, delivery time, and automation for enzyme modification and steroid compound catalysis.\n\n\n**Paper 5: Linguistic Laws Meet Protein Sequences: A Comparative Analysis of Subword Tokenization Methods**\n\n1. **Title:** Linguistic Laws Meet Protein Sequences: A Comparative Analysis of Subword Tokenization Methods\n\n2. **Abstract:** This study evaluates three subword tokenization methods (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece) on protein sequences, analyzing their effectiveness in protein sequence representation, domain boundary preservation, and adherence to established linguistic laws.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to compare the performance of different subword tokenization methods on protein sequences and assess their adherence to linguistic laws. The hypothesis is that  NLP-based tokenizers developed for human language may not be optimal for protein sequences, and that different tokenizers will exhibit different strengths and weaknesses in capturing the \"language\" of proteins.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** BPE showed better contextual specialization and marginally better domain boundary preservation at smaller vocabularies, while SentencePiece was more efficient in terms of token count. WordPiece offered a balance between these aspects. However, all methods struggled to maintain domain integrity, especially with larger vocabularies. Analysis of linguistic laws revealed partial compliance with Zipf's and Brevity laws but deviations from Menzerath's law, suggesting unique organizational principles in protein sequences compared to natural language.  The study highlights the need for protein-specific tokenization methods.\n\n\nThis analysis provides a high-level overview.  A more detailed analysis would require access to the full text of each paper.\n",
