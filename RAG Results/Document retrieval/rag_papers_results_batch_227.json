A major challenge in generalizing methods to protein complexes is that they often have very large treewidth, making algorithms like TreePack infeasible.  This paper introduces iTreePack, which solves the side-chain packing problem for complexes using dual decomposition and tree decomposition.  It decomposes a protein complex into smaller subgraphs, solves each subgraph separately, and uses a projected subgradient algorithm to ensure consistency. Results show iTreePack outperforms SCWRL4 on protein complexes, especially those with large treewidths.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a more efficient and accurate algorithm for protein complex side-chain packing than existing methods, which struggle with the high treewidth of complex interaction graphs. The hypothesis is that dual decomposition, combined with tree decomposition on smaller subgraphs, will overcome the limitations of large treewidth and improve accuracy and efficiency.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** iTreePack significantly outperforms SCWRL4 on protein complexes, particularly those with high treewidth.  It achieves this by decomposing the complex into smaller, more manageable subgraphs, solving them individually using tree decomposition, and then iteratively reconciling the solutions.  iTreePack is also more efficient than SCWRL4, especially for large complexes.  Even on monomeric proteins, it's faster and slightly more accurate.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** ENERGY-BASED MODELS FOR ATOMIC-RESOLUTION PROTEIN CONFORMATIONS\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper proposes an energy-based model (EBM) of protein conformations at the atomic scale, trained solely on crystallized protein data.  It's evaluated on the rotamer recovery task, a benchmark for protein design energy functions.  The model achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art Rosetta energy function.  Analysis of model outputs and representations shows it captures physicochemical properties relevant to protein energy.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to learn an atomic-resolution energy function for protein conformations directly from data, rather than relying on hand-engineered features and physical principles. The hypothesis is that a deep learning model can learn an effective energy function that performs comparably to established, knowledge-based methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The Atom Transformer model achieves rotamer recovery performance close to that of the Rosetta energy function, a widely used and highly refined benchmark.  The model shows distinct energy behavior between core and surface residues and a relationship between residue size and energy well depth.  It also learns the symmetries of some amino acids. Analysis of hidden representations shows clustering of core and surface residues in the embedding space.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** The synergy between protein positioning and DNA elasticity: energy minimization of protein-decorated DNA minicircles\n\n2. **Abstract:**  This paper presents a new method to minimize the elastic energy of DNA fragments at the mesoscale level, allowing for spatially constrained terminal base pairs and bound proteins.  It investigates the effects of HU and Hbb proteins on circular DNA with varying torsional stress.  Results reveal cooperation between DNA elasticity and protein-induced distortions, showing that torsional stress influences protein placement, and proteins alter stress to affect distant sites.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a method to minimize the elastic energy of protein-decorated DNA minicircles to understand the interplay between protein binding and DNA deformation. The hypothesis is that the elastic properties of DNA and the positioning of proteins are interdependent, and this interaction will be revealed through energy minimization.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The energy landscapes for minicircles with one or two HU/Hbb dimers show periodic minima corresponding to optimal protein placements.  The presence of a protein significantly influences the optimal binding sites for other proteins.  Torsional stress in the DNA strongly influences protein placement, and the proteins in turn alter the torsional stress.  The results suggest that DNA acts as a communication medium between proteins through elastic deformation.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Viscosity of protein-stabilised emulsions: contributions of components and development of a semi-predictive model\n\n2. **Abstract:**  This paper investigates the viscosity of protein-stabilised emulsions by characterizing the rheological behavior of pure suspensions of proteins (sodium caseinate) and protein-stabilised droplets.  It models the viscosity of these components using equations for hard and soft colloidal particles and uses these models to develop a semi-empirical model for the viscosity of mixtures.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to model the viscosity of protein-stabilised emulsions by considering them as mixtures of soft colloidal particles (unadsorbed proteins and protein-coated droplets). The hypothesis is that the viscosity behavior of the emulsion can be predicted from the individual behavior of its components, treated within a soft colloid framework.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The viscosity of droplet suspensions shows a sharp divergence at high volume fractions, characteristic of hard-sphere suspensions, while protein suspensions exhibit a power-law increase.  A modified Quemada model fits the protein suspension data well.  A simple semi-empirical model, assuming independent contributions from proteins and droplets, reasonably predicts the viscosity of the mixtures. The study supports the use of a soft colloidal framework for modeling both proteins and protein-stabilized droplets.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** TaxDiff: Taxonomic-Guided Diffusion Model for Protein Sequence Generation\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper introduces TaxDiff, a taxonomic-guided diffusion model for controllable protein sequence generation. It combines taxonomic information with diffusion models to generate structurally stable proteins.  Taxonomic control is integrated into each transformer block, and a patchify attention mechanism captures global and local sequence features. Experiments show TaxDiff outperforms other models in both unconditional and taxonomic-guided generation, even exceeding structure-based models in some metrics and requiring significantly less time.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a controllable protein sequence generation model that incorporates taxonomic information to guide the generation process. The hypothesis is that incorporating taxonomic information into a diffusion model will allow for the generation of structurally stable and biologically relevant protein sequences specific to different taxonomic groups, improving upon the limitations of unconditional generation models.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** TaxDiff significantly outperforms baseline models in both unconditional and taxonomic-guided protein sequence generation.  It achieves higher scores for structural similarity (TM-score), lower RMSD, higher sequence consistency (Fident), and higher pLDDT scores (indicating higher confidence in predicted structures).  The patchify attention mechanism significantly improves efficiency, reducing generation time by a factor of 4 compared to other diffusion models.  The results demonstrate TaxDiff's ability to generate high-quality, taxonomically-specific protein sequences.\n",
