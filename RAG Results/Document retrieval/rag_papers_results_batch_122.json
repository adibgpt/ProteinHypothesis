Diffusion on language model embeddings for protein sequence generation**\n\n1. **Title:** Diffusion on language model embeddings for protein sequence generation\n\n2. **Abstract:** Protein design requires a deep understanding of the inherent complexities of the protein universe. While many efforts lean towards conditional generation or focus on specific families of proteins, the foundational task of unconditional generation remains underexplored and undervalued.  Here, we explore this pivotal domain, introducing DiMA, a model that leverages continuous diffusion on embeddings derived from the protein language model, ESM-2, to generate amino acid sequences. DiMA surpasses leading solutions, including autoregressive transformer-based and discrete diffusion models, and we quantitatively illustrate the impact of the design choices that lead to its superior performance. We extensively evaluate the quality, diversity, distribution similarity, and biological relevance of the generated sequences using multiple metrics across various modalities. Our approach consistently produces novel, diverse protein sequences that accurately reflect the inherent structural and functional diversity of the protein space. This work advances the field of protein design and sets the stage for conditional models by providing a robust framework for scalable and high-quality protein sequence generation.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a diffusion model (DiMA) for *unconditional* generation of high-quality and diverse protein sequences using continuous representations (embeddings) learned from a protein language model (ESM-2). The hypothesis is that leveraging continuous diffusion on pLM embeddings will lead to superior protein sequence generation compared to existing autoregressive and discrete diffusion methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** DiMA outperforms existing autoregressive transformer-based and discrete diffusion models in generating amino acid sequences.  It achieves higher quality (measured by pLDDT, TM-score, BLAST identity) and diversity (SeqD, clustering) and better captures the distribution of the training data (FPD, MMD, OT).  Ablation studies confirm the importance of key architectural choices (ESM-2 encoder, self-conditioning, specific noise schedule, skip connections).  The generated sequences demonstrate biological relevance, exhibiting natural-like distributions of domain lengths, IDR lengths, and secondary structure elements.\n\n\n**2. Osmolyte-Induced Protein Stability Changes Explained by Graph Theory**\n\n1. **Title:** Osmolyte-Induced Protein Stability Changes Explained by Graph Theory\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Provided in the excerpt)\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the molecular mechanisms behind osmolyte-induced protein stability changes, focusing on the role of preferential exclusion and osmolyte clustering. The hypothesis is that the stabilizing/destabilizing effects of osmolytes on proteins during heat-mediated denaturation can be explained by analyzing the compactness of protein interaction networks and osmolyte-osmolyte interaction networks using graph theory.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The study combines experimental measurements (ITF) and MD simulations to analyze the effects of various osmolytes (sucrose, trehalose, sorbitol, glycerol, urea) on the thermal stability of two model proteins (Lysozyme and \u03b2-lactoglobulin). They found a strong negative correlation between melting temperature (Tm) and the preferential interaction coefficient, supporting the preferential exclusion theory.  A positive correlation between osmolyte-osmolyte clustering and preferential exclusion suggests that exclusion might be driven by steric hindrance from osmolyte aggregates.  Graph-theoretical analysis of residue interaction networks (RINs) showed that proteins in solutions with stability-enhancing osmolytes have more compact interaction networks.\n\n\n**3. On the optimal contact potential of proteins**\n\n1. **Title:** On the optimal contact potential of proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not provided in the excerpt)\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper analytically investigates the lower bound of the total conformational energy of a protein structure, assuming it's approximated by the sum of sequence-dependent pairwise contact energies. The hypothesis is that the condition for the native structure achieving this lower bound will lead to a contact energy matrix that is a scalar multiple of the native contact matrix (Go potential).\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors derive the lower bound of the total conformational energy and show that the native structure achieving this lower bound implies a contact energy matrix (E-matrix) that is a scalar multiple of the native contact matrix (Go potential).  They derive spectral relations between the contact matrix and energy matrix and discuss approximations related to one-dimensional protein structures. The results suggest that protein structure prediction could be simplified by constructing optimal energy matrices or that contact potentials alone might be insufficient for accurate prediction.\n\n\n**4. Blind prediction of protein B-factor and flexibility**\n\n1. **Title:** Blind prediction of protein B-factor and flexibility\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Provided in the excerpt)\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a machine learning-based method for *blind* prediction of protein B-factors (a measure of atomic flexibility) using both local (MWCGs) and global features from protein structures. The hypothesis is that combining local features capturing intrinsic flexibility with global features representing experimental conditions will enable accurate blind prediction of B-factors, surpassing the accuracy of traditional least-squares fitting methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors use multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCGs) as local features to represent protein structures, along with global features like resolution and protein size.  They apply random forest, gradient boosted trees, and convolutional neural networks to predict B-factors.  The convolutional neural network method demonstrates the best performance, achieving higher accuracy in blind prediction than traditional methods like GNM that rely on least-squares fitting.  The results show that machine learning approaches can effectively predict protein B-factors across different proteins without prior fitting to individual proteins.\n\n\n**5. Solving Maximum Clique Problem for Protein Structure Similarity**\n\n1. **Title:** Solving Maximum Clique Problem for Protein Structure Similarity\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Provided in the excerpt)\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper focuses on improving the efficiency of protein structure alignment algorithms.  The hypothesis is that formulating the protein structure alignment problem as a maximum weighted clique problem and solving it using optimized integer programming or branch and bound algorithms will be significantly faster than existing methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The authors propose a new integer programming formulation for solving the maximum weighted clique problem in protein structure alignment. They also develop a dedicated branch and bound algorithm for the maximum cardinality clique problem.  Computational results show that their branch and bound algorithm significantly outperforms the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm (used in VAST) for large protein structures, achieving speedups of up to 116 times for the largest proteins.\n",
