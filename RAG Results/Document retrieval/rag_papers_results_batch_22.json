        "response": "Here are summaries of the provided papers, following the requested format.\n\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** Statistical Inference for template-based protein structure prediction\n\n2. **Abstract:** Protein structure prediction is a challenging problem in computational biology. Template-based modeling, identifying templates with solved crystal structures and constructing 3D models based on sequence/structure alignments, is the most successful approach.  The thesis introduces statistical machine learning methods to build accurate alignments, especially for distantly related proteins.  For single-template proteins, a regression-tree-based CRF model is developed. For multiple-template proteins, a probabilistic consistency approach is used.  The methods are implemented in the RaptorX server, which performed well in CASP9.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve the accuracy of template-based protein structure prediction by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for more accurate sequence-structure alignments, particularly for proteins with only distantly related templates. The hypothesis is that incorporating nonlinear relationships between sequence and structural features, and a probabilistic consistency approach for multiple templates, will lead to improved prediction accuracy.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The developed methods, implemented in the RaptorX server, achieved second place among all automated servers in CASP9 and were the best for the most difficult 50 template-based modeling targets (mostly low-homology proteins).  The use of regression trees in a CRF model effectively leveraged correlations among sequence and structural features, and the probabilistic consistency approach improved predictions using multiple templates.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein Inference and Protein Quanti\ufb01cation: Two Sides of the Same Coin\n\n2. **Abstract:** In mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics, protein quantification and protein identification are computationally challenging. The paper investigates the feasibility of using protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem.  The hypothesis is that protein inference (determining protein presence) can be viewed as a special case of protein quantification (calculating abundance), where absent proteins have zero abundance. Three simple quantification methods are tested.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to explore the connection between protein inference and quantification in shotgun proteomics. The hypothesis is that protein inference can be effectively addressed by treating it as a special case of protein quantification, where the presence of a protein is indicated by a non-zero abundance.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Experimental results on six datasets showed that the three simple protein quantification methods (multiple counting, equal division, and a linear programming model) were competitive with existing protein inference algorithms.  This supports the hypothesis that viewing protein inference as a special case of quantification is a promising approach for developing more effective algorithms.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** CodonMPNN for Organism Specific and Codon Optimal Inverse Folding\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Generating protein sequences conditioned on protein structures is important for protein engineering.  However, expression rates can be low due to suboptimal codon sequences. CodonMPNN generates codon sequences conditioned on protein backbone structure and organism label. The hypothesis is that, since naturally occurring DNA sequences are close to codon optimality, CodonMPNN can generate codon sequences with higher expression yields than heuristic codon choices for generated amino acid sequences.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve protein engineering by generating codon sequences directly from protein structures, conditioned on the host organism, rather than generating amino acid sequences and then optimizing codons. The hypothesis is that this approach will lead to codon sequences with higher expression yields.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** CodonMPNN retained the performance of previous inverse folding approaches (similar recovery rates and designability). It recovered wild-type codons more frequently than baselines.  Furthermore, CodonMPNN had a higher likelihood of generating high-fitness codon sequences than low-fitness ones for the same protein sequence, indicating its ability to capture codon optimality.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Perturbation waves in proteins and protein networks: Applications of percolation and game theories in signaling and drug design\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided as a separate section but implied throughout the introduction). The paper reviews the application of network theory, game theory, and percolation theory to understand perturbation waves (propagating structural changes) in proteins and protein-protein interaction networks.  It explores how these theories can be used to model protein-protein interactions, interactome dynamics, and the propagation of perturbations in cellular networks.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to use network theory (including game theory and percolation theory) to model and understand the dynamic behavior of proteins and protein interaction networks, specifically focusing on the propagation of perturbations (conformational changes). The hypothesis is that these theoretical frameworks can provide insights into protein function, regulation, and drug design.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper reviews several applications of these theories:  game theory to model the multi-step process of protein-protein interactions; percolation theory to analyze amino acid networks during protein folding and to identify modules in protein-protein interaction networks; and the use of perturbation wave models to study signal transduction and cellular dynamics. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential applications of these methodologies in drug design.  Specific results from each theoretical application are presented, but not summarized into a single quantitative result.\n",
