One of the challenges of identifying reliable DDIs is domain promiscuity. Promiscuous domains are domains that can occur in many domain architectures and are therefore found in many proteins. This becomes a problem for a method where the score of a domain-pair is the ratio between observed and expected frequencies because the PPI network is sparse. As such, many protein-pairs will be non-interacting and domain-pairs with promiscuous domains will be penalized. This domain promiscuity challenge to the problem of inferring reliable DDIs from PPIs has been recognized, and a number of work-arounds have been proposed. In this paper, we report an application of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to this problem. We find that the relationship between formal concepts provide a natural way for rare domains to elevate the rank of promiscuous domains, and enrich highly ranked domain-pairs with reliable DDIs. This piggy-backing of promiscuous domains onto rare domains is possible due to the domain architecture of proteins which mixes promiscuous with rare domains.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to use Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to improve the identification of reliable domain-domain interactions (DDIs) from protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, overcoming the problem of domain promiscuity. The hypothesis is that FCA, by leveraging the relationships between formal concepts, will allow rare domains to boost the scores of promiscuous domains, leading to a higher enrichment of highly-ranked DDIs with true gold-standard DDIs (GDDIs).\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The FCA-based method, using a concept lattice that is not attribute-reduced, outperforms a traditional associative method in recovering GDDIs and in passing the Nye test (a test for whether the highest-ranking DDI for a gold-PPI is a GDDI).  The success of the method relies on two conditions: mixed domain architecture in proteins and the use of a non-attribute-reduced concept lattice.  The \"piggy-backing\" mechanism, where rare domains enhance the scores of promiscuous domains, is key to this improvement.\n\n\n**Paper 2:  Analysis of Coronavirus Envelope Protein with Cellular Automata (CA) Model**\n\n1. **Title:** Analysis of Coronavirus Envelope Protein with Cellular Automata (CA) Model\n\n2. **Abstract:** The reason of significantly higher transmissibility of SARS Covid (2019 CoV-2) compared to SARS Covid (2003 CoV) and MERS Covid (2012 MERS) can be attributed to mutations reported in structural proteins, and the role played by non-structural proteins (nsps) and accessory proteins (ORFs) for viral replication, assembly, and shedding. Envelope protein E is one of the four structural proteins of minimum length. Recent studies have confirmed critical role played by the envelope protein in the viral life cycle including assembly of virion exported from infected cell for its transmission. However, the determinants of the highly complex viral - host interactions of envelope protein, particularly with host Golgi complex, have not been adequately characterized. CoV-2 and CoV Envelope proteins of length 75 and 76 amino acids differ in four amino acid locations. The additional amino acid Gly (G) at location 70 makes CoV length 76. The amino acid pair EG at location 69-70 of CoV in place of amino acid R in location 69 of CoV-2, has been identified as a major determining factor in the current investigation. This paper concentrates on the design of computational model to compare the structure/function of wild and mutants of CoV-2 with wild and mutants of CoV in the functionally important region of the protein chain pair. We hypothesize that differences of CAML model parameter of CoV-2 and CoV characterize the deviation in structure and function of envelope proteins in respect of interaction of virus with host Golgi complex; and this difference gets reflected in the difference of their transmissibility. The hypothesis has been validated from single point mutational study on- (i) human HBB beta-globin hemoglobin protein associated with sickle cell anemia, (ii) mutants of envelope protein of Covid-2 infected patients reported in recent publications. For each of these case studies, the CAML model parameter differ between wild and specific mutant that represent deviation of the structure-function of the mutant from that of wild leading to a specific disease. From detailed analysis of the characteristics of proteins of three viruses (CoV-2, CoV, MERS) and a few other virus proteins with CAML model, a Machine Learning (ML) framework has been designed. This ML framework enables us to report - (i) the contribution of higher transmissibility of CoV-2 envelope protein compared to CoV envelope protein, and (ii) a list of possible Covid-2 envelope protein mutants which may appear in future.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper aims to develop a computational model (CAML) using cellular automata to analyze the structure and function of coronavirus envelope proteins, particularly focusing on the differences between CoV-2 and CoV, and to relate these differences to their transmissibility. The hypothesis is that differences in CAML model parameters (specifically DCLVS-AA and DCLVS-CDS) between CoV-2 and CoV correlate with differences in their structure-function, particularly concerning the interaction with the host Golgi complex, and that this difference explains the variation in their transmissibility.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The CAML model, validated against mutational studies of HBB and CoV-2 envelope proteins, shows a significant difference in DCLVS-AA between CoV-2 and CoV/MERS, suggesting a difference in their interaction with the host Golgi complex and explaining the higher transmissibility of CoV-2.  The amino acid pair EG at positions 69-70 in CoV, replaced by R at position 69 in CoV-2, is identified as a key factor influencing this difference.  The model also predicts potential future CoV-2 envelope protein mutants.\n\n\n**Paper 3: PEER: A Comprehensive and Multi-Task Benchmark for Protein Sequence Understanding**\n\n1. **Title:** PEER: A Comprehensive and Multi-Task Benchmark for Protein Sequence Understanding\n\n2. **Abstract:** We are now witnessing significant progress of deep learning methods in a variety of tasks (or datasets) of proteins. However, there is a lack of a standard benchmark to evaluate the performance of different methods, which hinders the progress of deep learning in this field. In this paper, we propose such a benchmark called PEER, a comprehensive and multi-task benchmark for Protein sEquence undERstanding. PEER provides a set of diverse protein understanding tasks including protein function prediction, protein localization prediction, protein structure prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, and protein-ligand interaction prediction. We evaluate different types of sequence-based methods for each task including traditional feature engineering approaches, different sequence encoding methods as well as large-scale pre-trained protein language models. In addition, we also investigate the performance of these methods under the multi-task learning setting. Experimental results show that large-scale pre-trained protein language models achieve the best performance for most individual tasks, and jointly training multiple tasks further boosts the performance.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper introduces PEER, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating protein sequence understanding methods.  There's no explicit hypothesis stated in the abstract; the main goal is to provide a standardized benchmark to facilitate progress in the field.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The PEER benchmark evaluates various sequence-based methods across 14 tasks related to protein function, localization, structure, and interactions. Results show that large-scale pre-trained protein language models (like ESM-1b) generally achieve the best performance on individual tasks. Multi-task learning further improves the performance of some models (especially CNN and ESM-1b), but the effectiveness depends on the choice of auxiliary tasks.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Statistical thermodynamics of membrane bending mediated protein-protein attractions**\n\n1. **Title:** Statistical thermodynamics of membrane bending mediated protein-protein attractions\n\n2. **Abstract:** Integral membrane proteins deform the surrounding bilayer creating long-ranged forces that influence distant proteins. These forces can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the proteins\u2019 shape, height, contact angle with the bilayer, as well as the local membrane curvature. Although interaction energies are not pairwise additive, for sufficiently low protein density, thermodynamic properties depend only upon pair interactions. Here, we compute pair interaction potentials and entropic contributions to the two-dimensional osmotic pressure of a collection of noncircular proteins. In contrast to direct short-ranged interactions such as van der Waal\u2019s, hydrophobic, or electrostatic interactions, both local membrane Gaussian curvature and protein ellipticity can induce attractions between two proteins at distances of up to ten times their typical radii. For flat membranes, bending rigidities of \u223c30kBT, and moderate ellipticities, we find thermally averaged attractive interactions of order \u223c2kBT. These interactions may play an important role in the intermediate stages of protein aggregation.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the long-range interactions between integral membrane proteins mediated by membrane bending. The hypothesis is that the interplay between protein non-circularity and background Gaussian curvature can induce attractive interactions between proteins at distances significantly larger than those of direct short-range interactions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors derive a theoretical model showing that non-circular membrane proteins can exhibit long-range attractive interactions (up to ten times their radius) due to membrane bending. This attraction is influenced by protein ellipticity and background membrane curvature.  Even for flat membranes, significant attractive interactions are predicted under certain conditions.  These findings suggest a mechanism for protein aggregation.\n\n\n**Paper 5: Cotranslational Folding Can Accelerate Protein Folding in Vivo**\n\n1. **Title:** Cotranslational Folding Can Accelerate Protein Folding in Vivo\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided in the excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper uses computational modeling to investigate how cotranslational protein folding (folding during translation) affects protein evolution.  The hypothesis is that evolutionary pressures select for proteins that can efficiently fold cotranslationally to avoid misfolding and degradation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Simulations show that proteins evolve two distinct strategies for cotranslational folding: folding early or late during translation.  Proteins folding early are characterized by lower contact order and the formation of stable native-like conformations early in the translation process. Proteins folding late have higher contact order and form fewer native contacts at intermediate lengths.  Evolution favors cotranslational folding to enhance protein stability and speed while minimizing the time spent in unfolded, vulnerable states. The study also finds that proteins evolved to fold cotranslationally exhibit slower in vitro folding kinetics.  Finally, the placement of slowly translating codons is shown to be influenced by contact order.\n",
