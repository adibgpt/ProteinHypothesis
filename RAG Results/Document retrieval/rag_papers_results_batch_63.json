Discontinuous molecular dynamic simulations were performed for different sizes of the bias gap g, an artificial measure of a model protein\u2019s preference for its native state. The thermodynamic transition temperatures are obtained by calculating the squared radius of gyration Rg2, the root-mean-squared pair separation fluctuation \u2206B, the specific heat Cv, the internal energy of the system E, and the Lindemann disorder parameter \u2206L. In spite of the simplicity, the protein-like heteropolymers have shown a complex set of protein transitions as observed in experimental studies. Starting from high temperature, these transitions include a collapse transition, a disordered-to-ordered globule transition, a folding transition, and a liquid-to-solid transition. These transitions strongly depend on the native-state geometry of the model proteins and the size of the bias gap.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** To investigate the thermodynamic properties of \u03b2-strand proteins using simplified off-lattice models to understand the mechanisms underlying protein aggregation, particularly the role of \u03b2-strands.  The implicit hypothesis is that the model's behavior will reveal insights into real protein aggregation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Three four-strand antiparallel \u03b2-sheet models (\u03b2-double-hairpin, \u03b2-clip, \u03b2-twist) exhibited complex transitions (collapse, disordered-to-ordered globule, folding, liquid-to-solid) depending on temperature and the bias gap (g), which represents the protein's preference for its native state.  Larger bias gaps favored native state formation, while smaller gaps resulted in partially-ordered globules, differing geometrically from the native state.  The native state of the \u03b2-double-hairpin was liquid-like (molten globule), while the \u03b2-clip and \u03b2-twist native states were surface-molten solids.  The study highlights the influence of native-state geometry and bias gap on protein phase behavior.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Conserved network motifs allow protein-protein interaction prediction\n\n2. **Abstract:** We show that we can use the conserved properties of the protein network to identify and validate interaction candidates. We apply a number of machine learning algorithms to the protein connectivity information and achieve a surprisingly good overall performance in predicting interacting proteins. Using a \u201cleave-one-out\u201d approach we find average success rates between 20-50% for predicting the correct interaction partner of a protein. We demonstrate that the success of these methods is based on the presence of conserved interaction motifs within the network.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The hypothesis is that conserved network motifs in protein-protein interaction networks can be used to predict new interactions.  The main idea is to leverage the topological properties of known interactions to predict unknown ones using recommender systems.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Three recommender algorithms (signature, aggregation, probabilistic) achieved 20-50% success in predicting protein-protein interactions using only connectivity information. Success correlated strongly with the density of conserved network motifs (triads and tetrads), particularly in proteins with higher node degrees.  An optimized algorithm using motif density information achieved a 50% success rate on a high-confidence subset of interactions. The results suggest that network topology, specifically conserved motifs, is a strong predictor of protein interactions.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Designing Novel Protein Structures Using Sequence Generator and AlphaFold2\n\n2. **Abstract:** Protein structures and functions are determined by a contiguous arrangement of amino acid sequences. Designing novel protein sequences and structures with desired geometry and functions is a complex task with large state spaces. Here we develop a novel protein design pipeline consisting of two deep learning algorithms, ProteinSolver and AlphaFold2. ProteinSolver is a deep graph neural network that generates amino acid sequences such that the forces between interacting amino acids are favorable and compatible with the fold while AlphaFold2 is a deep learning algorithm that predicts the protein structures from protein sequences. We present forty de novo designed binding sites of the PTP1B and P53 proteins with high precision, out of which thirty proteins are novel. Using ProteinSolver and AlphaFold2 in conjunction, we can trim the exploration of the large protein conformation space, thus expanding the ability to \ufb01nd novel and diverse de novo protein designs.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that combining a deep graph neural network (ProteinSolver) for sequence generation with AlphaFold2 for structure prediction will efficiently design novel protein structures, specifically binding sites, overcoming the challenges of the large protein conformation space.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A pipeline combining ProteinSolver and AlphaFold2 successfully generated 40 de novo binding sites for PTP1B and P53 proteins.  30 of these designs were novel (RMSD > 1\u00c5 when comparing only the masked region). The pipeline demonstrates the potential for efficient design of novel protein structures for therapeutic applications.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** PersGNN: Applying Topological Data Analysis and Geometric Deep Learning to Structure-Based Protein Function Prediction\n\n2. **Abstract:** Understanding protein structure-function relationships is a key challenge in computational biology, with applications across the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. While it is known that protein structure directly impacts protein function, many functional prediction tasks use only protein sequence. In this work, we isolate protein structure to make functional annotations for proteins in the Protein Data Bank in order to study the expressiveness of different structure-based prediction schemes. We present PersGNN\u2014an end-to-end trainable deep learning model that combines graph representation learning with topological data analysis to capture a complex set of both local and global structural features. While variations of these techniques have been successfully applied to proteins before, we demonstrate that our hybridized approach, PersGNN, outperforms either method on its own as well as a baseline neural network that learns from the same information. PersGNN achieves a 9.3% boost in area under the precision recall curve (AUPR) compared to the best individual model, as well as high F1 scores across different gene ontology categories, indicating the transferability of this approach.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with topological data analysis (persistent homology) will improve structure-based protein function prediction by capturing both local and global structural features more effectively than either method alone.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** PersGNN, a hybrid model combining GNNs and persistent homology (PersNet), outperformed GNNs, PersNet, and a baseline MLP in predicting molecular function GO terms.  PersGNN showed a 9.3% increase in AUPR compared to the best individual model and maintained high F1 scores across different GO categories, even with limited training data.  The results indicate that the combined approach captures complementary structural information, leading to improved prediction accuracy.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** Leveraging Sequence Embedding and Convolutional Neural Network for Protein Function Prediction\n\n2. **Abstract:** The capability of accurate prediction of protein functions and properties is essential in the biotechnology industry, e.g. drug development and arti\ufb01cial protein synthesis, etc. The main challenges of protein function prediction are the large label space and the lack of labeled training data. Our method leverages unsupervised sequence embedding and the success of deep convolutional neural network to overcome these challenges. In contrast, most of the existing methods delete the rare protein functions to reduce the label space. Furthermore, some existing methods require additional bio-information (e.g., the 3-dimensional structure of the proteins) which is dif\ufb01cult to be determined in biochemical experiments. Our proposed method signi\ufb01cantly outperforms the other methods on the publicly available benchmark using only protein sequences as input. This allows the process of identifying protein functions to be sped up.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that combining unsupervised sequence embedding (treating amino acid triplets as tokens and using ELMo for embedding) with a deep convolutional neural network (inception network) will improve protein function prediction accuracy, even with a large label space and limited labeled data.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The proposed model, using ELMo embeddings and an inception network, achieved state-of-the-art performance on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot dataset for protein function prediction using only protein sequences as input. It outperformed existing methods like BLAST, DeepGO, and PANNZER2, and had significantly faster inference times.  The method effectively addressed the challenges of large label space and limited labeled data by leveraging unsupervised sequence embedding.\n",
