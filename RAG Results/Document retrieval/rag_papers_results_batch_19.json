        "response": "Here's a summary of the main idea and key results of each paper, based on the provided excerpts:\n\n**1. Title:** Asymptotics of a Brownian ratchet for Protein Translocation\n\n**Abstract:** Protein translocation in cells has been modelled by Brownian ratchets. In such models, the protein diffuses through a nanopore. On one side of the pore, ratcheting molecules bind to the protein and hinder it to diffuse out of the pore. We study a Brownian ratchet by means of a reflected Brownian motion (Xt)t\u22650 with a changing reflection point (Rt)t\u22650. The rate of change of Rt is \u03b3(Xt \u2212Rt) and the new reflection boundary is distributed uniformly between Rt\u2212and Xt. The asymptotic speed of the ratchet scales with \u03b31/3 and the asymptotic variance is independent of \u03b3.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper models protein translocation using a Brownian ratchet, a model where a protein diffuses through a nanopore, hindered from diffusing back by ratcheting molecules binding on one side.  The hypothesis is that this model can accurately describe the asymptotic speed and variance of protein translocation, with the speed scaling proportionally to \u03b3^(1/3) (where \u03b3 represents the rate of change of the reflection point).\n\n**Summary of Results:**  The authors prove a Law of Large Numbers (Theorem 1) showing the asymptotic speed of the ratchet is proportional to \u03b3^(1/3), and a Central Limit Theorem (Theorem 2) demonstrating that the asymptotic variance is independent of \u03b3.  The numerical value for the speed is approximated, and the asymptotic standard deviation is conjectured based on simulations. The model is extended to include factors like dissociation rates and force-dependent protein movement, suggesting that the efficiency of the ratchet depends on the concentration of ratcheting molecules.\n\n\n**2. Title:** Solvent content of protein crystals from diffraction intensities by Independent Component Analysis\n\n**Abstract:** An analysis of the protein content of several crystal forms of proteins has been performed. We apply a new numerical technique, the Independent Component Analysis (ICA), to determine the volume fraction of the asymmetric unit occupied by the protein. This technique requires only the crystallographic data of structure factors as input.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper proposes using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), a statistical method, to determine the protein fraction in protein crystals using only diffraction intensity data. The underlying hypothesis is that the observed diffraction intensities are a linear mixture of signals from the protein and the solvent, and that these signals are statistically independent.\n\n**Summary of Results:** The authors apply ICA to separate protein and solvent contributions from diffraction data.  The results show satisfactory agreement between protein fractions calculated using ICA and the Matthews' method, a commonly used technique.  The paper suggests potential applications of ICA for phasing procedures and improving solvent modeling in protein crystallography.\n\n\n**3. Title:** Evolution of Protein Interaction Networks by Whole Genome Duplication and Domain Shuffling\n\n**Abstract:** Successive whole genome duplications have recently been firmly established in all major eukaryote kingdoms. It is not clear, however, how such a dramatic evolutionary process has contributed to shape the large-scale topology of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We propose and analytically solve a generic model of PPI network evolution under successive whole genome duplications. This demonstrates that the observed scale-free degree distributions and conserved multi-protein complexes may have concomitantly arisen from i) intrinsic exponential dynamics of PPI network evolution and ii) asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates. This requirement of asymmetric divergence is in fact \u201cspontaneously\u201d fulfilled at the level of protein-binding domains. In addition, domain shuffling of multi-domain proteins is shown to provide a powerful combinatorial source of PPI network innovation, while preserving essential structures of the underlying single-domain interaction network. Finally, large-scale features of PPI networks reflecting the \u201ccombinatorial logic\u201d behind direct and indirect protein interactions are well reproduced numerically with only two adjusted parameters of clear biological significance.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper models the evolution of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks through successive whole-genome duplications. The hypothesis is that the observed scale-free degree distributions and conserved complexes in PPI networks result from a combination of exponential network growth dynamics and asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates, particularly at the level of protein-binding domains.  Domain shuffling is also considered as a mechanism for network innovation.\n\n**Summary of Results:**  A mathematical model of PPI network evolution under whole-genome duplication is developed and solved analytically. The model predicts two main regimes: an exponential regime with no topology conservation and a scale-free regime with local topology conservation. The scale-free regime requires asymmetric divergence of duplicated proteins. The model is extended to include domain shuffling, which is shown to contribute to network innovation while preserving essential topological features.  The model is fitted to yeast PPI data, showing good agreement with observed degree distributions and average connectivity of first neighbors, supporting the hypothesis.\n\n\n**4. Title:** ONTOPROTEIN: PROTEIN PRETRAINING WITH GENE ONTOLOGY EMBEDDING\n\n**Abstract:** Self-supervised protein language models have proved their effectiveness in learning the proteins representations. With the increasing computational power, current protein language models pre-trained with millions of diverse sequences can advance the parameter scale from million-level to billion-level and achieve remarkable improvement. However, those prevailing approaches rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better protein representations. We argue that informative biology knowledge in KGs can enhance protein representation with external knowledge. In this work, we propose OntoProtein, the first general framework that makes use of structure in GO (Gene Ontology) into protein pre-training models. We construct a novel large-scale knowledge graph that consists of GO and its related proteins, and gene annotation texts or protein sequences describe all nodes in the graph. We propose novel contrastive learning with knowledge-aware negative sampling to jointly optimize the knowledge graph and protein embedding during pre-training. Experimental results show that OntoProtein can surpass state-of-the-art methods with pre-trained protein language models in TAPE benchmark and yield better performance compared with baselines in protein-protein interaction and protein function prediction.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper proposes OntoProtein, a novel framework for protein pre-training that integrates external knowledge from Gene Ontology (GO) into protein language models. The hypothesis is that incorporating structured biological knowledge from GO will improve the performance of downstream protein tasks.\n\n**Summary of Results:** OntoProtein achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TAPE benchmark, outperforming existing methods in several tasks, particularly token-level tasks like secondary structure prediction and contact prediction. It also shows improved performance in protein-protein interaction and protein function prediction tasks.  The authors emphasize that OntoProtein is model-agnostic and easily integrated into existing frameworks.  The construction of a new large-scale knowledge graph, ProteinKG25, is also highlighted as a key contribution.\n\n\n**5. Title:** Purcell radiative rate enhancement of label-free proteins with ultraviolet aluminum plasmonics\n\n**Abstract:** The vast majority of proteins are intrinsically fluorescent in the ultraviolet, thanks to the emission from their tryptophan and tyrosine amino-acid constituents. However, the protein autofluorescence quantum yields are generally very low due to the prevailing quenching mechanisms by other amino acids inside the protein. This motivates the interest to enhance the radiative emission rate of proteins using nanophotonic structures. Although there have been numerous reports of Purcell effect and local density of optical states (LDOS) control in the visible range using single dipole quantum emitters, the question remains open to apply these concepts in the UV on real proteins containing several tryptophan and tyrosine amino acids arranged in a highly complex manner. Here, we report the first complete characterization of the Purcell effect and radiative rate enhancement for the UV intrinsic fluorescence of label-free \u03b2-galactosidase and streptavidin proteins in plasmonic aluminum nanoapertures. We find an excellent agreement with a calibration performed using a high quantum yield UV fluorescent dye. Demonstrating and intensifying the Purcell effect is essential for the applications of UV plasmonics and the label-free detection of single proteins.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the possibility of enhancing the weak ultraviolet (UV) autofluorescence of label-free proteins using aluminum plasmonic nanoapertures. The hypothesis is that the Purcell effect, which enhances spontaneous emission rates in a controlled photonic environment, can be applied to improve the UV fluorescence of proteins, despite their complex structure and low quantum yields.\n\n**Summary of Results:** The authors experimentally demonstrate Purcell enhancement of the UV autofluorescence of \u03b2-galactosidase and streptavidin proteins using aluminum nanoapertures.  They observe a radiative rate enhancement (Purcell factor) of approximately 2x for both proteins, comparable to the enhancement observed for a high-quantum yield UV dye.  The results show that the nanoapertures increase both the radiative rate and the quantum yield of the proteins, despite inherent quenching mechanisms.  This work provides the first clear demonstration of the Purcell effect applied to label-free proteins in the UV range.\n",
