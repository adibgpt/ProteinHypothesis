Single particle analysis using Cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM), combined with machine learning algorithms, provides a way to reveal the dynamics within the protein system from noisy micrographs. Here, we introduce an improved computational method that uses Gaussian mixture models for protein structure representation and deep neural networks for conformation space embedding. By integrating information from molecular models into the heterogeneity analysis, we can resolve complex protein conformational changes at near atomic resolution and present the results in a more interpretable form.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve CryoEM heterogeneity analysis by integrating molecular model information into a deep learning framework using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).  The hypothesis is that incorporating prior knowledge from molecular models will improve the accuracy and interpretability of CryoEM analysis, especially at high resolution where signal-to-noise ratio is low.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper presents a memory-efficient implementation of GMMs for high-resolution protein structure representation.  It demonstrates three ways to integrate molecular models: hierarchical GMMs for large-scale movements, rigid body motion modeling for localized domain movements, and bond constraints for high-resolution refinement.  A method for combining multiple heterogeneity analysis modes is also presented. The approach is shown to be effective in analyzing complex conformational changes in TRPV1 and GLP-1 receptor datasets at near-atomic resolution.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 MAPE-PPI: TOWARDS EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION PREDICTION VIA MICROENVIRONMENT-AWARE PROTEIN EMBEDDING\n\n2. **Abstract:** Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are fundamental in various biological processes and play a key role in life activities. The growing demand and cost of experimental PPI assays require computational methods for efficient PPI prediction. While existing methods rely heavily on protein sequence for PPI prediction, it is the protein structure that is the key to determine the interactions. To take both protein modalities into account, we define the microenvironment of an amino acid residue by its sequence and structural contexts, which describe the surrounding chemical properties and geometric features. In addition, microenvironments defined in previous work are largely based on experimentally assayed physicochemical properties, for which the \u201cvocabulary\u201d is usually extremely small. This makes it difficult to cover the diversity and complexity of microenvironments. In this paper, we propose Microenvironment-Aware Protein Embedding for PPI prediction (MPAE-PPI), which encodes microenvironments into chemically meaningful discrete codes via a sufficiently large microenvironment \u201cvocabulary\u201d (i.e., codebook). Moreover, we propose a novel pre-training strategy, namely Masked Codebook Modeling (MCM), to capture the dependencies between different microenvironments by randomly masking the codebook and reconstructing the input. With the learned microenvironment codebook, we can reuse it as an off-the-shelf tool to efficiently and effectively encode proteins of different sizes and functions for large-scale PPI prediction. Extensive experiments show that MAPE-PPI can scale to PPI prediction with millions of PPIs with superior trade-offs between effectiveness and computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art competitors.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction by incorporating both sequence and structural information through a novel \"microenvironment-aware\" protein embedding. The hypothesis is that by learning a comprehensive representation of amino acid microenvironments,  a more accurate and efficient PPI prediction model can be built, especially for large-scale datasets.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** MAPE-PPI, a method using microenvironment-aware protein embeddings and Masked Codebook Modeling (MCM) for pre-training, shows superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods on large-scale PPI prediction datasets (millions of PPIs).  The learned microenvironment codebook effectively captures dependencies between microenvironments and enables efficient protein encoding.  The method demonstrates better trade-offs between effectiveness and computational efficiency than existing sequence- and structure-based approaches.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Buried and accessible surface area control intrinsic protein flexibility\n\n2. **Abstract:** Proteins experience a wide variety of conformational dynamics that can be crucial for facilitating their diverse functions. How is the intrinsic flexibility required for these motions encoded in their three-dimensional structures? Here, the overall flexibility of a protein is demonstrated to be tightly coupled to the total amount of surface area buried within its fold. A simple proxy for this, the relative solvent accessible surface area (Arel), therefore shows excellent agreement with independent measures of global protein flexibility derived from various experimental and computational methods. Application of Arel on a large scale demonstrates its utility by revealing unique sequence and structural properties associated with intrinsic flexibility. In particular, flexibility as measured by Arel shows little correspondence with intrinsic disorder, but instead tends to be associated with multiple domains and increased \u03b1-helical structure. Furthermore, the apparent flexibility of monomeric proteins is found to be useful for identifying quaternary structure errors in published crystal structures. There is also a strong tendency for the crystal structures of more flexible proteins to be solved to lower resolutions. Finally, local solvent accessibility is shown to be a primary determinant of local residue flexibility. Overall this work provides both fundamental mechanistic insight into the origin of protein flexibility and a simple, practical method for predicting flexibility from protein structures.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the relationship between a protein's buried surface area (as approximated by relative solvent accessible surface area, Arel) and its intrinsic flexibility. The hypothesis is that the amount of buried surface area is directly related to a protein's flexibility; proteins with more buried surface area will be less flexible, and vice-versa.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A strong correlation was found between Arel and various independent measures of protein flexibility (normal mode analysis, NMR RMSF, molecular dynamics simulations, NMR chemical shifts).  Arel was shown to be a good predictor of global protein flexibility.  Analysis revealed that flexibility is associated with multiple domains and increased \u03b1-helical content, but shows little correlation with intrinsic disorder.  Arel also proved useful in identifying potential errors in quaternary structure assignments from crystal structures, and in explaining the relationship between protein flexibility and crystal structure resolution.  Finally, local solvent accessibility was found to be a key determinant of local residue flexibility.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein folding in the modern era: a pedestrian\u2019s guide\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided in the excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper reviews methods for predicting protein structure, focusing on machine learning (AlphaFold) and quantum computing approaches.  The underlying hypothesis is that the amino acid sequence of a protein contains all the necessary information to determine its native (minimum energy) structure, and that computational methods can be developed to efficiently predict this structure.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper describes Anfinisen's experiments demonstrating that a protein's native structure is determined by its sequence and the thermodynamic principle of minimizing Gibbs free energy.  It discusses Levinthal's paradox and the concept of funnel-shaped energy landscapes to explain the speed of protein folding.  A detailed explanation of AlphaFold's deep learning approach to protein structure prediction is provided, highlighting its success in the CASP competition.  The paper then introduces the use of quantum computing for protein folding, specifically focusing on lattice protein models and quantum annealing.  It explains how quantum computers might offer advantages in exploring the vast conformational space of proteins, but notes that the technology is still in its early stages.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** A Categorical Compositional Distributional Modelling for the Language of Life\n\n2. **Abstract:** The Categorical Compositional Distributional (DisCoCat) Model is a powerful mathematical model for composing the meaning of sentences in natural languages. Since we can think of biological sequences as the \u201dlanguage of life\u201d, it is attempting to apply the DisCoCat model on the language of life to see if we can obtain new insights and a better understanding of the latter. In this work, we took an initial step towards that direction. In particular, we choose to focus on proteins as the linguistic features of protein are the most prominent as compared with other macromolecules such as DNA or RNA. Concretely, we treat each protein as a sentence and its constituent domains as words. The meaning of a word or the sentence is just its biological function, and the arrangement of domains in a protein corresponds to the syntax. Putting all those into the DisCoCat framework, we can \u201dcompute\u201d the function of a protein based on the functions of its domains with the grammar rules that combine them together. Since the functions of both the protein and its domains are represented in vector spaces, we provide a novel way to formalize the functional representation of proteins.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper explores the application of the DisCoCat model (a natural language processing model) to understand protein function.  The hypothesis is that protein structure and function can be modeled using a compositional approach similar to how sentence meaning is derived from word meanings in natural language.  Proteins are treated as sentences, and domains as words.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper demonstrates how the DisCoCat framework can be used to \"compute\" the function of a protein based on the functions of its constituent domains, using a combination of grammar typing and vector space representations of domains.  Examples using Drosophila proteins (DAT, FoxP, p53, Fru, Sxc) illustrate the process.  The authors acknowledge limitations in the grammar typing system and vector space representations, suggesting further work is needed to make the approach more robust and complete.\n",
