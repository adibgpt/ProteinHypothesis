        "response": "Here are summaries of the provided papers, incorporating title, abstract (where available), main idea/hypothesis, and results:\n\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** Ultrafast solvation dynamics at internal site of staphylococcal nuclease investigated by site-directed mutagenesis\n\n2. **Abstract:** Solvation is essential for protein activities. To study internal solvation of protein, site-directed mutagenesis is applied. Intrinsic fluorescent probe, tryptophan, is inserted into desired position inside protein molecule for ultrafast spectroscopic study.  The studies are carried out on a globular protein, staphylococcal nuclease. The solvation at internal sites of the caves indicate clear characteristics of local environment. These solvation behaviors correlated to the enzyme activity directly.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the ultrafast solvation dynamics within the internal cavities of a protein (staphylococcal nuclease, SNase) using site-directed mutagenesis to insert tryptophan as a fluorescent probe. The hypothesis is that the solvation dynamics at internal sites will exhibit characteristics reflecting the local environment and directly correlate with enzyme activity.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The study used site-directed mutagenesis to insert tryptophan into various positions within SNase.  Time-resolved spectroscopy revealed distinct solvation relaxation timescales (\u03c41 and \u03c42) and energy changes (Stokes shifts) in different regions of the protein (Ca2+ binding pocket, hydrophobic core). The Ca2+ binding pocket exhibited the slowest dynamics and largest energy changes, while the hydrophobic core showed the fastest dynamics and smallest energy changes. These differences directly correlate with protein stability and substrate binding/hydrolysis. The method demonstrates a powerful approach to studying protein dynamics.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Comment on \u201dStatistical Mechanics of Membrane-Protein Conformation: A Homopolymer Model\u201d\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided, but the comment critiques a previous paper.)\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The comment critiques a previous paper's model of membrane-protein conformation using a homopolymer model.  The implicit hypothesis of the critiqued paper is that a homopolymer model adequately represents the complex interactions of a membrane protein.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The comment argues that the homopolymer model is unrealistic in several aspects:  different chemical potentials inside and outside the cell are not considered; the head-tail distinguishability of the protein sequence is not properly accounted for; adsorption and inclusion processes are treated as the same order; and the model is inconsistent with high-resolution structural findings of \u03b1-hemolysin. The author suggests that a more realistic model would consider the protein as multiple units interacting via hydrophobic and hydrophilic contacts, rather than a single chain winding on the membrane.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Role of electrostatic interactions in the assembly of empty spherical viral capsids\n\n2. **Abstract:** We examine the role of electrostatic interactions in the assembly of empty spherical viral capsids.  We investigate whether the interplay of repulsive electrostatic and attractive interactions between the protein subunits can result in the formation of spherical viral capsids of a preferred radius. We \ufb01nd that the attractive interactions must depend on the angle between the neighboring protein subunits (i.e. on the mean curvature of the viral capsid) so that a particular angle(s) is (are) preferred energywise. Our results for the electrostatic contributions to energetics of viral capsids nicely correlate with recent experimental determinations of the energetics of protein-protein contacts in Hepatitis B virus.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the role of electrostatic interactions in the self-assembly of empty spherical viral capsids.  The hypothesis is that the interplay between repulsive electrostatic interactions and attractive (non-electrostatic) interactions between protein subunits determines the preferred radius of the assembled capsid.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Two electrostatic models of viral capsids were explored.  The results show that the Debye-H\u00fcckel approximation, previously used in similar studies, has limited validity, especially at low salt concentrations. The authors find that for a preferred capsid radius to exist, the attractive interactions must be angle-dependent (curvature-dependent). The electrostatic contribution to the capsid energetics correlates well with experimental data for Hepatitis B virus.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Optimization of protein force-field parameters with the Protein Data Bank\n\n2. **Abstract:** We propose a novel method to optimize existing force-\ufb01eld parameters for protein systems. The method consists of minimizing the summation of the square of the force acting on each atom in the proteins with the structures from the Protein Data Bank. We performed this optimization to the partial-charge and torsion-energy parameters of the AMBER parm96 force \ufb01eld, using 100 molecules from the Protein Data Bank. We then performed folding simulations of \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-hairpin peptides. The optimized force-\ufb01eld parameters gave structures more similar to the experimental implications than the original AMBER force \ufb01eld.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a novel method to optimize existing protein force field parameters by minimizing the forces acting on atoms in known protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The hypothesis is that optimizing these parameters based on experimental structures will improve the accuracy of simulations, particularly in predicting protein folding.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors optimized the partial charge and backbone torsion energy parameters of the AMBER parm96 force field using 100 protein structures from the PDB.  Folding simulations of \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-hairpin peptides using the optimized force field yielded structures more consistent with experimental observations than those obtained with the original AMBER parm96 force field.  The optimized force field showed improved performance in predicting secondary structure content.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** Modeling Protein Contact Networks\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided, but the thesis summary provides a good overview)\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The thesis investigates protein structures using a complex network approach. The underlying hypothesis is that the topological properties of protein contact networks (PCNs) at different length scales are related to their structure, function, and folding kinetics.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The thesis uses protein contact networks (PCNs) and long-range interaction networks (LINs) to model protein structures.  Key findings include:  proteins are \"small-world\" networks regardless of structural class; proteins exhibit assortative mixing (an unusual property for most networks); assortativity correlates positively with folding rate; and clustering in LINs correlates negatively with folding rate.  These findings suggest that network topology plays a significant role in protein folding and function.\n",
