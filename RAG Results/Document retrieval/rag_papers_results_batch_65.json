An approach that has gathered momentum since the late 1990\u2019s, looks at protein heteropolymers and their folding process through the lens of complex network analysis.  The present paper is primarily a review of this rich area. But it delves deeper into certain aspects by emphasizing short-range and long-range links, and suggests unconventional places where \u201cpower-laws\u201d may be lurking within protein contact networks. Further, it considers the dynamical view of protein contact networks.  The grand challenge of protein folding is to elucidate the process(es) which not only generates the specific and diverse linkage patterns of protein contact networks, but also reproduces the dynamic behavior of proteins as they fold.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper reviews the application of complex network analysis to understand protein folding.  It hypothesizes that a deeper understanding of both the static (topological) and dynamic characteristics of protein contact networks (PCNs) is crucial for developing a comprehensive network-based model of protein folding *ab initio*.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The analysis of two protein datasets (GH64 and EVA132) revealed several key characteristics of PCNs:  approximately 30% of links are long-range; link sequence distance follows a power-law-like distribution; for smaller proteins, the maximum link sequence distance is about 70% of the protein's size; mean node degree is around 8 and independent of protein size;  ~60% of nodes participate in long-range interactions; PCNs exhibit high clustering coefficients and assortativity.  A preliminary network model of protein folding, incorporating these findings, was developed but showed limitations in accurately replicating all observed characteristics.  The study highlights the need for more sophisticated models that consider dynamic aspects and specific linkage patterns to fully capture the complexity of protein folding.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Simulated evolution of protein-protein interaction networks with realistic topology**\n\n1. **Title:** Simulated evolution of protein-protein interaction networks with realistic topology\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper aims to create a minimal model of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network evolution that accurately captures a broad range of topological properties. The hypothesis is that PPI networks evolve primarily through two mechanisms: gene duplication followed by diversification, and neofunctionalization (new interactions arising from mutations), with an increased likelihood of interactions forming between proteins in a target protein's neighborhood (assimilation).\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The DUNE model (Duplication & NEofunctionalization), incorporating gene duplication, neofunctionalization, and assimilation, successfully reproduced 10 topological properties of PPI networks in yeast, fruit flies, and humans.  Key findings include: modular structures emerge without specific selection pressures; proteins are separated by about six degrees; PPI network diameter grows over time (unlike social networks); older proteins are more central and highly connected; and the model suggests a way to infer evolutionary history from present-day proteomics data.  Sensitivity analysis showed that the gene duplication rate and link divergence probability are crucial for network modularity and diameter.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Theory and simulations for crowding-induced changes in stability of proteins with applications to \u03bb repressor**\n\n1. **Title:** Theory and simulations for crowding-induced changes in stability of proteins with applications to \u03bb repressor\n\n2. **Abstract:** Experiments and theories have shown that when steric interactions between crowding particles and proteins are dominant, which give rise to Asakura-Oosawa depletion forces, then the stabilities of the proteins increase compared to the in\ufb01nite dilution case. We show using theoretical arguments that the crowder volume fraction (\u03a6C) dependent increase in the melting temperature of globular proteins, \u2206Tm(\u03a6C) \u2248\u03a6\u03b1C where \u03b1 = 1/(3\u03bdeff\u22121). The effective Flory exponent, \u03bdeff, relates the radius of gyration in the unfolded state to the number of amino acid residues in the protein. We derive the bound 1.25 \u2264\u03b1 \u22642.0. The theoretical predictions are confirmed using molecular simulations of \u03bb repressor in the presence of spherical crowding particles. Analyses of previous simulations and experiments confirm the predicted theoretical bound for \u03b1. We show that the non-specific attractions between crowding particles and amino acid residues have to be substantial to fully negate the enhanced protein stabilities due to intra protein attractive Asakura-Oosawa (AO) depletion potential.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the effect of macromolecular crowding on protein stability, specifically focusing on the role of excluded volume interactions (Asakura-Oosawa depletion forces). The hypothesis is that the increase in protein melting temperature (\u2206Tm) due to crowding is proportional to \u03a6\u03b1C, where \u03a6C is the crowder volume fraction and \u03b1 is determined by the characteristics of the unfolded protein state.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Theoretical arguments predict a relationship between the increase in melting temperature (\u2206Tm) and crowder volume fraction (\u03a6C): \u2206Tm(\u03a6C) \u2248 \u03a6\u03b1C, where 1.25 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 2.0.  Molecular simulations of \u03bb repressor confirmed this prediction, yielding \u03b1 \u2248 1.5.  Analysis of previous simulations and experiments on ubiquitin supported the theoretical bounds for \u03b1. The study concludes that excluded volume effects are dominant in determining protein stability in crowded environments, even when considering weak attractive interactions between crowders and proteins.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Protein folding tames chaos**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein folding tames chaos\n\n2. **Abstract:** Protein folding produces characteristic and functional three-dimensional structures from unfolded polypeptides or disordered coils. The emergence of extraordinary complexity in the protein folding process poses astonishing challenges to theoretical modeling and computer simulations. The present work introduces molecular nonlinear dynamics (MND), or molecular chaotic dynamics, as a theoretical framework for describing and analyzing protein folding. We unveil the existence of intrinsically low dimensional manifolds (ILDMs) in the chaotic dynamics of folded proteins. Additionally, we reveal that the transition from disordered to ordered conformations in protein folding increases the transverse stability of the ILDM. Stated differently, protein folding reduces the chaoticity of the nonlinear dynamical system, and a folded protein has the best ability to tame chaos. Additionally, we bring to light the connection between the ILDM stability and the thermodynamic stability, which enables us to quantify the disorderliness and relative energies of folded, misfolded and unfolded protein states. Finally, we exploit chaos for protein flexibility analysis and develop a robust chaotic algorithm for the prediction of Debye - Waller factors, or temperature factors, of protein structures.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for understanding protein folding using molecular nonlinear dynamics (MND) and the concept of intrinsically low-dimensional manifolds (ILDMs). The central hypothesis is that protein folding acts to control chaos within the molecular system, leading to the emergence of stable ILDMs in the folded state.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study demonstrated that folded proteins can transition from chaotic dynamics to a periodic orbit on a low-dimensional manifold (ILMD).  The stability of this ILDM is linked to the thermodynamic stability of the protein conformation.  A new order parameter, based on the ILDM stability, was introduced to quantify the degree of order in protein conformations. The model accurately predicts relative energies of folded and unfolded states. Finally, a chaotic algorithm based on ILDM perturbation was developed for predicting Debye-Waller factors (B-factors), providing a new approach for protein flexibility analysis.\n",
