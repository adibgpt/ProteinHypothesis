Note that some sections may be incomplete due to missing information in the provided text.\n\n\n**Paper 1: STRUCTURE-ENHANCED PROTEIN INSTRUCTION TUNING: TOWARDS GENERAL-PURPOSE PROTEIN UNDERSTANDING**\n\n1. **Title:** STRUCTURE-ENHANCED PROTEIN INSTRUCTION TUNING: TOWARDS GENERAL-PURPOSE PROTEIN UNDERSTANDING\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Accurate prediction of protein properties and functions is crucial.  The paper introduces the Structure-Enhanced Protein Instruction Tuning (SEPIT) framework, integrating a structure-aware module into protein language models (pLMs) and connecting them to large language models (LLMs) for general-purpose protein understanding.  A two-stage instruction tuning pipeline is proposed, using a mixture of experts (MoEs).  The largest and most comprehensive protein instruction dataset to date is constructed.  Results demonstrate SEPIT's superior performance.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  Current protein language models are task-specific.  The hypothesis is that integrating structural information into pLMs and combining them with LLMs via instruction tuning, using a large, diverse dataset, will enable general-purpose protein understanding.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** SEPIT outperforms existing general LLMs and open-source LLMs trained with protein knowledge in open-ended generation and closed-set answer tasks.  The structure-aware module and MoEs significantly improve performance.  The large protein instruction dataset is crucial for success.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Crowding induced entropy-enthalpy compensation in protein association equilibria**\n\n1. **Title:** Crowding induced entropy-enthalpy compensation in protein association equilibria\n\n2. **Abstract:**  A statistical mechanical theory predicts the effects of macromolecular crowding on protein association equilibria, accounting for excluded volume and attractive interactions.  The theory agrees well with simulation data.  Attractive interactions between proteins and crowding agents counteract the stabilizing effects of excluded volume. A critical attraction strength, with no net crowding effect, is largely independent of crowder packing fraction.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  Existing theories of macromolecular crowding inadequately account for attractive interactions between proteins and crowding agents. The hypothesis is that a theory incorporating both excluded volume and attractive interactions will accurately predict the effects of crowding on protein association equilibria.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The developed theory accurately predicts binding free energies from simulations over a wide range of parameters.  Attractive crowder-protein interactions counteract the stabilizing effect of excluded volume.  A critical attraction strength, where crowding has no net effect, is approximately independent of crowder packing fraction.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Protein gradients in single cells induced by their coupling to \u201cmorphogen\u201d-like diffusion**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein gradients in single cells induced by their coupling to \u201cmorphogen\u201d-like diffusion\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper proposes a novel mechanism for protein gradient formation in single cells.  It suggests that proteins couple with a diffusing molecule (\"pronogen\"), produced at one end of the cell and degraded throughout. This coupling leads to a non-linear diffusion-degradation model, resulting in a steady-state protein concentration gradient.  A stability analysis shows these gradients are linearly stable.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  Existing differential diffusion models are limited in explaining protein gradient formation in single cells without sources or sinks. The hypothesis is that coupling proteins to a \"pronogen\" with a diffusion-degradation profile will create stable protein gradients.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The model predicts stable protein gradients through pronogen-protein coupling. Two scenarios are identified: synergistic (protein free energy decreases with pronogen association) and antagonistic (protein free energy increases).  The protein profile follows or is complementary to the pronogen profile, respectively.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Top-down machine learning of coarse-grained protein force-fields**\n\n1. **Title:** Top-down machine learning of coarse-grained protein force-fields\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The paper presents a method for learning coarse-grained protein force fields using differentiable trajectory reweighting.  The method only requires native conformations, avoiding expensive reference calculations.  Two neural network potentials (NNPs) are trained: one for fast-folding proteins and a general NNP trained on a larger dataset.  The general NNP shows good generalization capabilities.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  Bottom-up methods for learning coarse-grained protein force fields are computationally expensive. The hypothesis is that a top-down approach using differentiable trajectory reweighting with only native conformations as training data will efficiently learn accurate and transferable force fields.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The fast-folding protein NNP successfully recovers native conformations for most proteins. The general NNP, trained on a larger dataset, generalizes well to proteins outside the training set, demonstrating comparable performance to existing coarse-grained methods in de novo structure prediction.\n\n\n**Paper 5: Protein model quality assessment using rotation-equivariant, hierarchical neural networks**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein model quality assessment using rotation-equivariant, hierarchical neural networks\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper introduces a deep learning approach for assessing protein model quality, using a point-based representation and rotation-equivariant convolutions at different resolutions. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on CASP datasets without using physics-inspired energy terms or additional information beyond atomic coordinates.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** Existing deep learning methods for protein model quality assessment often rely on physics-based terms or additional data. The hypothesis is that a rotation-equivariant, hierarchical neural network learning directly from atomic coordinates will provide superior model quality assessment.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The method achieves state-of-the-art results on CASP11 and CASP12 datasets, outperforming methods that utilize physics-inspired energy terms or multiple sequence alignments.  Analysis of learned embeddings suggests the network captures information on inter-atomic interactions and secondary structure.\n",
