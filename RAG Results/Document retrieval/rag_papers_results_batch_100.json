Methods like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure prediction based only on the amino-acid sequence. However, proteins often appear in multiple different conformations, and it is highly relevant to resolve the full conformational distribution. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo EM) is a powerful tool for capturing a large number of images of a given protein, frequently in different conformations (referred to as particles). The images are, however, very noisy projections of the protein, and traditional methods for cryo EM reconstruction are limited to recovering a single, or a few, conformations. In this paper, we introduce cryoSPHERE, a deep learning method that takes as input a nominal protein structure, e.g. from AlphaFold, learns how to divide it into segments, and how to move these as approximately rigid bodies to fit the different conformations present in the cryo EM dataset. This formulation is shown to provide enough constraints to recover meaningful reconstructions of single protein structures. This is illustrated in three examples where we show consistent improvements over the current state-of-the-art for heterogeneous reconstruction.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** CryoSPHERE aims to improve heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM by modeling protein conformations as rigid-body movements of segments within a base structure (e.g., from AlphaFold). The hypothesis is that this approach will be more robust to noise and computationally efficient than methods that treat each residue independently.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  CryoSPHERE demonstrates improved performance over cryoDRGN on three datasets (toy, SARS-CoV-2 spike, and molecular dynamics simulations of bacterial phytochrome) across different metrics (FSC curves, distances between domains).  The method is shown to be efficient, robust to noise and data scarcity, and provides interpretable results by outputting segment movements.  The use of a fitted AlphaFold base structure significantly improves the accuracy of the reconstruction.\n\n\n**Paper 2: A simple physical model for scaling in protein-protein interaction networks**\n\n1. **Title:** A simple physical model for scaling in protein-protein interaction networks\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Not provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the scale-free topology observed in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.  The hypothesis is that the observed scale-free nature of these networks, despite inconsistencies between independent experiments, is primarily due to non-specific hydrophobic interactions rather than specific evolved interactions.  The low correlation between independent experiments is attributed to different protein surfaces being exposed in each experiment.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors demonstrate weak correlation between two independent yeast PPI datasets (Ito and Uetz), suggesting significant experimental noise.  A physical model (MpK) based on hydrophobic interactions is proposed, which successfully reproduces the scale-free topology and other higher-order network properties (clustering coefficient scaling) of the experimental datasets. A strong correlation is found between protein connectivity and the fraction of hydrophobic residues on its surface, supporting the model.  The results suggest that the scale-free topology may arise from non-specific interactions, challenging interpretations based solely on evolutionary dynamics.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Selection maintaining protein stability at equilibrium**\n\n1. **Title:** Selection maintaining protein stability at equilibrium\n\n2. **Abstract:** The common understanding of protein evolution has been that neutral mutations are fixed by random drift, and a proportion of neutral mutations depending on the strength of structural and functional constraints primarily determines evolutionary rate. Recently it was indicated that fitness costs due to misfolded proteins are a determinant of evolutionary rate and selection originating in protein stability is a driving force of protein evolution. Here we examine protein evolution under the selection maintaining protein stability. Protein fitness is a generic form of fitness costs due to misfolded proteins; s = \u03ba exp(\u2206G/kT)(1 \u2212exp(\u2206\u2206G/kT)), where s and \u2206\u2206G are selective advantage and stability change of a mutant protein, \u2206G is the folding free energy of the wild-type protein, and \u03ba is a parameter representing protein abundance and indispensability. The distribution of \u2206\u2206G is approximated to be a bi-Gaussian distribution, which represents structurally slightly- or highly-constrained sites. Also, the mean of the distribution is negatively proportional to \u2206G. The evolution of this gene has an equilibrium point (\u2206Ge) of protein stability, the range of which is consistent with observed values in the ProTherm database. The probability distribution of Ka/Ks, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate per site, over fixed mutants in the vicinity of the equilibrium shows that nearly neutral selection is predominant only in low-abundant, non-essential proteins of \u2206Ge > \u22122.5 kcal/mol. In the other proteins, positive selection on stabilizing mutations is significant to maintain protein stability at equilibrium as well as random drift on slightly negative mutations, although the average \u27e8Ka/Ks\u27e9is less than 1. Slow evolutionary rates can be caused by both high protein abundance/indispensability and large effective population size, which produces positive shifts of \u2206\u2206G through decreasing \u2206Ge, and strong structural constraints, which directly make \u2206\u2206G more positive. Protein abundance/indispensability more affect evolutionary rate for less constrained proteins, and structural constraint for less abundant, less essential proteins. The effect of protein indispensability on evolutionary rate may be hidden by the variation of protein abundance and detected only in low-abundant proteins. Also, protein stability (\u2212\u2206Ge/kT) and \u27e8Ka/Ks\u27e9are predicted to decrease as growth temperature increases.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the role of protein stability in shaping protein evolutionary rates.  The hypothesis is that selection for maintaining protein stability at equilibrium plays a significant role, and that this selection pressure interacts with factors like protein abundance, indispensability, and structural constraints to determine evolutionary rates.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A model incorporating fitness costs due to misfolded proteins is developed.  The model predicts an equilibrium protein stability (\u2206Ge) that is consistent with observed data.  Analysis of Ka/Ks shows that nearly neutral selection is dominant only in low-abundance, non-essential proteins.  In other proteins, positive selection for stabilizing mutations is significant, along with random drift of slightly destabilizing mutations.  Evolutionary rates are influenced by protein abundance/indispensability and structural constraints, with their relative importance depending on protein characteristics.  The model predicts a decrease in protein stability and \u27e8Ka/Ks\u27e9 with increasing growth temperature.\n\n\n**Paper 4: DOCKGAME: Cooperative Games for Multimeric Docking**\n\n1. **Title:** DOCKGAME: COOPERATIVE GAMES FOR MULTIMERIC RIGID PROTEIN DOCKING\n\n2. **Abstract:** Protein interactions and assembly formation are fundamental to most biological processes. Predicting the assembly structure from constituent proteins \u2013 referred to as the protein docking task \u2013 is thus a crucial step in protein design applications. Most traditional and deep learning methods for docking have focused mainly on binary docking, following either a search-based, regression-based, or generative modeling paradigm. In this paper, we focus on the less-studied multimeric (i.e., two or more proteins) docking problem. We introduce DOCKGAME, a novel game-theoretic framework for docking \u2013 we view protein docking as a cooperative game between proteins, where the final assembly structure(s) constitute stable equilibria w.r.t. the underlying game potential. Since we do not have access to the true potential, we consider two approaches - i) learning a surrogate game potential guided by physics-based energy functions and computing equilibria by simultaneous gradient updates, and ii) sampling from the Gibbs distribution of the true potential by learning a diffusion generative model over the action spaces (rotations and translations) of all proteins. Empirically, on the Docking Benchmark 5.5 (DB5.5) dataset, DOCKGAME has much faster runtimes than traditional docking methods, can generate multiple plausible assembly structures, and achieves comparable performance to existing binary docking baselines, despite solving the harder task of coordinating multiple protein chains.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:**  DOCKGAME frames multimeric protein docking as a cooperative game, where proteins' actions (rotations and translations) aim to reach stable assembly structures (equilibria) defined by an underlying potential function.  The hypothesis is that this game-theoretic approach will be more efficient and allow for the generation of multiple plausible assembly structures compared to existing methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** DOCKGAME, using either a learnt potential function or a diffusion generative model, achieves comparable or better performance than existing binary docking baselines on the DB5.5 dataset, despite addressing the more complex multimeric docking problem.  It exhibits significantly faster runtimes and can generate multiple plausible assembly structures.  The self-supervised approach (using the diffusion generative model) outperforms the supervised approach (using a learnt potential function), suggesting limitations in using traditional physics-based scoring functions as a sole supervision signal.\n",
