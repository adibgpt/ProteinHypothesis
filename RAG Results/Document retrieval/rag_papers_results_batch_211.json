        "response": "Here's a summary of the main idea and key results of each paper, based on the provided excerpts and metadata:\n\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** Mobility Measurements Probe Conformational Changes in Membrane Proteins due to Tension\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The function of membrane proteins depends on their conformation. The paper demonstrates how conformational changes in asymmetric membrane proteins can be inferred from diffusion measurements.  Using membrane tension to control deformations, measurements of diffusivity infer how conformation is changed by tension, focusing on KvAP, a voltage-gated potassium channel.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that measuring the diffusivity of a membrane protein at different membrane tensions, coupled with an elastic model of the protein, will reveal how the protein's conformation changes in response to tension.  The authors hypothesize that a classical hydrodynamic explanation, using a covariant formulation of low Reynolds number hydrodynamics, can explain the observed changes in diffusion without invoking additional dissipative mechanisms.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The conformation of KvAP changes considerably due to tension, with its \"walls\" undergoing significant angular strains. The torsional stiffness was determined.  The results suggest that at sufficiently high tensions, the Brownian motion of KvAP is indistinguishable from a cylindrically shaped protein of the same radius. The authors' hydrodynamic model successfully explains the experimental data without needing additional dissipative mechanisms.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Hierarchy of events in protein folding: beyond the G\u014d model\n\n2. **Abstract:** Simplified G\u014d models are useful for characterizing protein folding but are limited because they treat all residues identically. The paper presents an extended C\u03b1-based G\u014d model where different residues interact with different energies. This model is used to calculate the thermodynamics of three small proteins and the effect of mutations.  The model suggests a hierarchical folding process where local elementary structures (LES) form early and drive the protein to its native conformation.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve upon the limitations of simplified G\u014d models by incorporating residue-specific interaction energies. The hypothesis is that a model incorporating these energies will better predict the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding, revealing a hierarchical folding process driven by the formation and interaction of local elementary structures (LES).\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The model successfully predicts experimentally accessible quantities (\u2206\u2206G\u2021N, \u2206\u2206GUN, \u03c6-values) for three small proteins (Protein G, Src-SH3, and CI2).  The simulations reveal a hierarchical folding process where stable LES form early, followed by the docking of these structures to form a folding nucleus (FN), leading to the native state. This supports a hierarchical folding mechanism, where smaller units coalesce into larger ones.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Remote Homology Detection in Proteins Using Graphical Models\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not fully provided, but implied from the text): The dissertation explores methods to improve remote homology detection in proteins, focusing on Markov random fields (MRFs).  It investigates the structural consistency of protein hierarchies and presents two approaches to make MRF-based homology detection computationally tractable: simplifying the MRF and using stochastic search.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to address the computational intractability of the SMURF Markov random field model for remote homology detection.  The hypothesis is that either simplifying the MRF (SMURFLite) or approximating its solution via stochastic search (MRFy) will improve remote homology detection accuracy while maintaining computational feasibility.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The dissertation shows a method for automatically clustering proteins that reasonably approximates the SCOP hierarchy. Two approaches to improve remote homology detection for \u03b2-structural proteins are presented: SMURFLite (simplifying the MRF) and MRFy (stochastic search). Both methods show improvements over existing methods (HMMER, RAPTOR, HHPred) in terms of AUC.  MRFy's local search significantly outperforms its simulated annealing and genetic algorithm implementations.  The results suggest that a two-phase approach (fast initial scan followed by more intensive analysis of candidates) could be effective for whole-genome annotation.\n\n\n**Paper 4:** (This is a paper based on a subset of the dissertation, and is covered in the dissertation summary above.)
