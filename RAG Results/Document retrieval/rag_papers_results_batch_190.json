A Thermal Study of Terahertz Induced Protein Interactions**\n\n1. **Title:** A Thermal Study of Terahertz Induced Protein Interactions\n2. **Abstract:** Proteins can be regarded as thermal nanosensors in an intra-body network. Upon being stimulated by Terahertz (THz) frequencies that match their vibrational modes, protein molecules experience resonant absorption and dissipate their energy as heat, undergoing a thermal process. This paper aims to analyze the effect of THz signaling on the protein heat dissipation mechanism...\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the thermal effects of terahertz (THz) radiation on protein molecules, hypothesizing that THz radiation, tuned to the resonant frequency of specific proteins, can induce controlled temperature changes impacting thermally-gated ion channels.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study uses a mathematical model (Goldenberg and Tranter) and COMSOL simulations to show that THz radiation can induce controlled temperature changes in protein patches.

The potential is obtained by optimization procedure, which simultaneously maximizes the energy gap for all proteins in the database...\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a new method for deriving protein folding potentials by optimizing for maximal energy gaps between native and non-native conformations across a dataset of proteins. The hypothesis is that this optimization approach will yield a more accurate and useful potential compared to existing statistical methods.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The method is tested using a lattice model and real protein structures.  In the lattice model, the new method accurately recovers a known \"true\" potential, outperforming existing methods. When applied to real proteins, the derived potential shows improved performance compared to existing potentials but still does not achieve sufficient accuracy for ab initio folding, suggesting the need for more complex energy functions.  The convergence of the optimization procedure provides a self-consistency check for the method.\n\n\n**25. A protein model exhibiting three folding transitions**\n\n1. **Title:** A protein model exhibiting three folding transitions\n2. **Abstract:** We explain the physical basis of a model for small globular proteins with water interactions. The water is supposed to access the protein interior in an \u201call-or-none\u201d manner during the unfolding of the protein chain. As a consequence of this mechanism (somewhat speculative), the model exhibits fundamental aspects of protein thermodynamics, as cold, and warm unfolding of the polypeptide chain, and hence decreasing the temperature below the cold unfolding the protein folds again, accordingly the heat capacity has three characteristic peaks.\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a model of small globular proteins that includes water interactions to explain the observed cold and warm unfolding transitions. The hypothesis is that the \"all-or-none\" access of water to the protein interior during unfolding, coupled with chain entropy effects, is responsible for the three observed folding transitions.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The model successfully reproduces cold and warm unfolding transitions observed experimentally, along with a cold folding transition at lower temperatures.  The sharpness of the transitions is analyzed, showing agreement with experimental data for warm unfolding and suggesting a different mechanism for cold folding.  The model shows that chain entropy is the driving force behind both cold folding and warm unfolding.\n\n",
