Protein design aims to identify sequences compatible with a given protein fold but incompatible to any alternative folds. To select the correct sequences and to guide the search process, a design scoring function is critically important. Such a scoring function should be able to characterize the global fitness landscape of many proteins simultaneously. Results. To find optimal design scoring functions, we introduce two geometric views and propose a formulation using mixture of nonlinear Gaussian kernel functions. We aim to solve a simplified protein sequence design problem. Our goal is to distinguish each native sequence for a major portion of representative protein structures from a large number of alternative decoy sequences, each a fragment from proteins of different fold. Our scoring function discriminate perfectly a set of 440 native proteins from 14 million sequence decoys. We show that no linear scoring function can succeed in this task. In a blind test of unrelated proteins, our scoring function misclassfies only 13 native proteins out of 194. This compares favorably with about 3\u22124 times more misclassifications when optimal linear functions reported in literature are used. We also discuss how to develop protein folding scoring function.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop an effective scoring function for protein design that can distinguish native protein sequences from a vast number of decoy sequences. The hypothesis is that a nonlinear scoring function, specifically a mixture of Gaussian kernel functions, will outperform linear scoring functions in this task because linear functions are too simplistic to capture the complexity of the protein design problem.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  A nonlinear scoring function (mixture of Gaussian kernels) was developed and successfully discriminated 440 native proteins from 14 million decoy sequences.  Linear scoring functions failed this task. In a blind test, the nonlinear function misclassified only 13 out of 194 proteins, significantly better than existing linear functions and statistical potentials.  The study suggests that nonlinear functions are necessary for effectively characterizing the fitness landscape of proteins for design purposes.\n\n\n**Paper 2**\n\n1. **Title:** The prion-like folding behavior in aggregated proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:**  Not provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates whether proteins exhibit prion-like behavior\u2014a change in conformation when aggregating\u2014using a 3D HP lattice model. The hypothesis is that the interfacial interaction strength between proteins in an aggregate will influence their folding behavior and stability, potentially leading to a conformational change analogous to prion conversion.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The 3D HP model showed that some protein sequences, when aggregated, change their most stable conformation compared to their isolated state. This prion-like behavior was dependent on the strength of the interfacial interactions.  Stronger interactions led to a more pronounced shift in the most stable structures. The study suggests a possible link between protein aggregation, conformational changes, and the strength of inter-protein interactions.\n\n\n**Paper 3**\n\n1. **Title:**  LEARNING THE LANGUAGE OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE\n\n2. **Abstract:** Representation learning and de novo generation of proteins are pivotal computational biology tasks. Whilst natural language processing (NLP) techniques have proven highly effective for protein sequence modelling, structure modelling presents a complex challenge, primarily due to its continuous and three-dimensional nature. Motivated by this discrepancy, we introduce an approach using a vector-quantized autoencoder that effectively tokenizes protein structures into discrete representations. This method transforms the continuous, complex space of protein structures into a manageable, discrete format with a codebook ranging from 4096 to 64000 tokens, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions with backbone root mean square deviations (RMSD) of approximately 1-5 \u00c5. To demonstrate the efficacy of our learned representations, we show that a simple GPT model trained on our codebooks can generate novel, diverse, and designable protein structures. Our approach not only provides representations of protein structure, but also mitigates the challenges of disparate modal representations and sets a foundation for seamless, multi-modal integration, enhancing the capabilities of computational methods in protein design.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a method to represent protein structures as discrete sequences (tokens) using a vector-quantized autoencoder, enabling the application of NLP techniques. The hypothesis is that this discrete representation will allow for high-fidelity reconstruction of protein structures and facilitate de novo protein structure generation using a standard sequence-based model like GPT.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A vector-quantized autoencoder using finite scalar quantization (FSQ) successfully tokenized protein structures, achieving backbone RMSDs of 1-5 \u00c5.  A GPT model trained on these tokenized structures generated novel, diverse, and designable protein structures, demonstrating the effectiveness of the learned discrete representation for downstream tasks like de novo protein design.  The results highlight the potential of applying NLP techniques to protein structure modeling.\n\n\n**Paper 4**\n\n1. **Title:** Network analysis of synonymous codon usage\n\n2. **Abstract:** Most amino acids are encoded by multiple synonymous codons. For an amino acid, some of its synonymous codons are used much more rarely than others. Analyses of positions of such rare codons in protein sequences revealed that rare codons can impact co-translational protein folding and that positions of some rare codons are evolutionary conserved. Analyses of positions of rare codons in proteins\u2019 3-dimensional structures, which are richer in biochemical information than sequences alone, might further explain the role of rare codons in protein folding. We analyze a protein set recently annotated with codon usage information, considering non-redundant proteins with sufficient structural information. We model the proteins\u2019 structures as networks and study potential differences between network positions of amino acids encoded by evolutionary conserved rare, evolutionary non-conserved rare, and commonly used codons. In 84% of the proteins, at least one of the three codon categories occupies significantly more or less network-central positions than the other codon categories. Different protein groups showing different codon centrality trends (i.e., different types of relationships between network positions of the three codon categories) are enriched in different biological functions, implying the existence of a link between codon usage, protein folding, and protein function.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate whether the network positions of amino acids encoded by different codon types (conserved rare, non-conserved rare, common) in protein 3D structures show significant differences. The hypothesis is that there is a relationship between codon usage, protein folding, and protein function, and that this relationship will be reflected in the network centrality of amino acids encoded by different codon types within the protein structure network.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Protein structures were modeled as networks.  Analysis of network centrality for amino acids encoded by different codon types revealed significant differences in their structural positions in 84% of the proteins studied.  Proteins grouped by these centrality trends showed enrichment in distinct biological functions. This suggests a link between codon usage patterns, protein structure, and function.\n",
