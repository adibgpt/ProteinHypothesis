        "response": "Here are summaries of the papers based on the provided excerpts and metadata.  Note that abstracts are only available for some papers.\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** Physical principles underpinning molecular-level protein evolution\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not available.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper investigates the fundamental physical principles governing protein evolution at the molecular level, driven by mutations.  The central hypothesis is that thermodynamic principles (Anfinsen's dogma) are tightly linked to protein evolution, influencing repeatability and reversibility of evolutionary pathways.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study analyzes convergent and divergent protein evolution models.  Convergent evolution, where multiple pathways lead to the same target sequence, is found to be influenced by the thermodynamic properties of the wild-type and target sequences, with repeatability determined by the probability of reaching the target sequence.  Divergent evolution, lacking a specific target, is strongly affected by mutation location and order, potentially leading to non-functional proteins if stability changes exceed a threshold. Post-translational modifications are also highlighted as significant evolutionary drivers.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** A unifying framework for amyloid-mediated membrane damage: The lipid-chaperon hypothesis\n\n2. **Abstract:** The review presents the lipid-chaperone hypothesis as a unifying framework for understanding amyloid-mediated membrane damage. It explores toxicity models, highlights the need for combined experimental and computational approaches, and discusses the role of lipid-protein complexes in switching between different membrane damage mechanisms.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to propose the lipid-chaperone hypothesis as a unifying explanation for the membrane-damaging effects of amyloidogenic proteins. This hypothesis posits that free lipids in the aqueous phase form stable complexes with amyloidogenic proteins, increasing their hydrophobicity and promoting membrane insertion.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper reviews existing toxicity models (amyloid hypothesis, toxic oligomer hypothesis) and introduces the lipid-chaperone hypothesis.  Experimental and computational evidence supports the hypothesis, demonstrating that the concentration of free lipids (CMC) acts as a switch, influencing whether pore formation, detergent-like mechanisms, or fibril formation dominate.  The study finds that lipid-protein complexes, particularly those with \u03b1-helical structures, increase hydrophobicity and promote membrane insertion.  This model is shown to apply to several amyloidogenic proteins (h-IAPP, A\u03b2, \u03b1S) and is contrasted with non-amyloidogenic proteins (r-IAPP, \u03b2S).\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** A Curated Rotamer Library for Common Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper presents curated side-chain rotamer libraries for common post-translational modifications (PTMs) derived from the RCSB PDB database.  These libraries improve upon existing methods in predicting experimental structures for PTMs in both folded proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:**  The paper aims to create improved rotamer libraries for PTMs to enhance the accuracy of protein structure prediction and ensemble generation, particularly for IDPs.  The underlying hypothesis is that by incorporating detailed information on PTM conformations from a curated dataset, more accurate models of protein structure and dynamics can be created.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Backbone-dependent (BD) and backbone-independent (BI) rotamer libraries for several PTMs (SEP, TPO, PTR, M3L, and ALY) were created. The BD library shows statistically significant improvements over existing methods (SIDEpro and Rosetta) in reproducing experimental structures for folded proteins, as measured by RMSD.  The libraries were successfully integrated into MCSCE and IDPConformerGenerator to generate all-atom conformers for both folded proteins and IDPs with PTMs. The results show that the PTMs introduce significant changes in sidechain packing and hydrogen bonding networks, particularly in IDRs.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Improving Neural Protein-Protein Interaction Extraction with Knowledge Selection\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The paper introduces a Knowledge Selection Model (KSM) for protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction that combines selected prior knowledge from knowledge bases (KBs) with contextual information.  It uses two modified Transformer encoders, a mutual attention mechanism, and a knowledge selector to achieve improved performance.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that selectively incorporating prior knowledge from KBs, in conjunction with contextual information from text, will improve the accuracy of PPI extraction. The model aims to avoid conflicts between prior knowledge and context by using a knowledge selector.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  KSM achieves state-of-the-art performance (38.08% F1-score) on the BioCreative VI PPI dataset. The knowledge selector is shown to be effective in improving performance, particularly when using the hyperbolic tangent activation function and Hadamard product for element-wise operations.  The mutual attention mechanism also contributes to improved accuracy by capturing important context features.  The model is also shown to generalize well to other relation extraction tasks (CDR).  Error analysis reveals that false positives stem from incorrect classification, while false negatives result from entity recognition errors, preprocessing rules, and incorrect classification.\n",
