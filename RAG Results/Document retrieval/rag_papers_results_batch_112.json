The possibility to encode for such functions is controlled by the balance between the amount of information supplied by the sequence and that left after that the protein has folded into its structure. We developed a computational algorithm to evaluate the amount of information necessary to specify the protein structure, keeping into account the thermodynamic properties of protein folding. We thus show that the information remaining in the protein sequence after encoding for its structure (the \u2018information gap\u2019) is very close to what needed to encode for its function and interactions. Then, by predicting the information gap directly from the protein sequence, we show that it may be possible to use these insights from information theory to discriminate between ordered and disordered proteins, to identify unknown functions, and to optimize designed proteins sequences.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to quantify how information in a protein sequence is partitioned between its structure and function. The hypothesis is that the information remaining after encoding for the structure (\"information gap\") is closely related to the information needed for function and interactions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors found that the information gap is approximately equal to the information needed for function and interactions.  They also showed that predicting the information gap from sequence alone can help distinguish ordered and disordered proteins, and potentially aid in identifying unknown functions and optimizing designed proteins.\n\n\n**Paper 22:**\n\n1. **Title:** HMACA: Towards Proposing a Cellular Automata Based Tool for Protein Coding, Promoter Region Identification and Protein Structure Prediction\n\n2. **Abstract:** Human body consists of lot of cells, each cell consist of DeOxaRibo Nucleic Acid (DNA). Identifying the genes from the DNA sequences is a very difficult task. But identifying the coding regions is more complex task compared to the former. Identifying the protein which occupy little place in genes is a really challenging issue. For understating the genes coding region analysis plays an important role. Proteins are molecules with macro structure that are responsible for a wide range of vital biochemical functions, which includes acting as oxygen, cell signaling, antibody production, nutrient transport and building up muscle fibers. Promoter region identification and protein structure prediction has gained a remarkable attention in recent years. Even though there are some identification techniques addressing this problem, the approximate accuracy in identifying the promoter region is closely 68% to 72%. We have developed a Cellular Automata based tool build with hybrid multiple attractor cellular automata (HMACA) classifier for protein coding region, promoter region identification and protein structure prediction which predicts the protein and promoter regions with an accuracy of 76%. This tool also predicts the structure of protein with an accuracy of 80%.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper proposes a cellular automata-based tool (HMACA) to predict protein coding regions, identify promoter regions, and predict protein structure. The hypothesis is that HMACA can improve the accuracy of these predictions compared to existing methods.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** HMACA achieved 76% accuracy in identifying promoter regions and 80% accuracy in protein structure prediction, exceeding the accuracy of some existing methods.\n\n\n**Paper 23:**\n\n1. **Title:** Anomalous diffusion of proteins in sheared lipid membranes\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided in the excerpt.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the diffusion properties of proteins in sheared lipid membranes using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The hypothesis is that shear flow will significantly affect the diffusion of proteins, potentially leading to anomalous diffusion.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** In membranes without proteins, normal diffusion of lipids was observed.  However, in sheared membranes with proteins, superdiffusion was observed in the shear direction and subdiffusion perpendicular to the flow. This superdiffusion was attributed to the accelerated motion of protein-lipid complexes within membrane voids created by hydrophobic mismatch and lipid transport by proteins.\n\n\n**Paper 24:**\n\n1. **Title:** RIGID PROTEIN-PROTEIN DOCKING VIA EQUIVARIANT ELLIPTIC-PARABOLOID INTERFACE PREDICTION\n\n2. **Abstract:** The study of rigid protein-protein docking plays an essential role in a variety of tasks such as drug design and protein engineering. Recently, several learning-based methods have been proposed for the task, exhibiting much faster docking speed than those computational methods. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method called ElliDock, which predicts an elliptic paraboloid to represent the protein-protein docking interface. To be specific, our model estimates elliptic paraboloid interfaces for the two input proteins respectively, and obtains the roto-translation transformation for docking by making two interfaces coincide. By its design, ElliDock is independently equivariant with respect to arbitrary rotations/translations of the proteins, which is an indispensable property to ensure the generalization of the docking process. Experimental evaluations show that ElliDock achieves the fastest inference time among all compared methods and is strongly competitive with current state-of-the-art learning-based models such as DiffDock-PP and Multimer particularly for antibody-antigen docking.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper introduces ElliDock, a method for rigid protein-protein docking that uses elliptic paraboloids to represent the docking interface. The hypothesis is that this approach will be faster and more accurate than existing methods, especially for antibody-antigen docking.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** ElliDock achieved the fastest inference time among compared methods and showed strong competitive performance with state-of-the-art models, particularly for antibody-antigen docking.\n\n\n**Paper 25:**\n\n1. **Title:** The catalogue of possible \u03b8-curves in proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:** Apart from the knots formed by the main-chain, the proteins can form numerous topological structures, when included the covalent and ion-mediated interactions. In this work, we de\ufb01ne the protein non-trivial \u03b8-curves and identify 7 di\ufb00erent topologies in all structures known up to date. We study the correlation of the motif with the function and organism of origin, and pointing the similarity with main-chain knots, we show that some motifs may indeed be functional. We also analyze the folding and bridge-induced stability of an exemplary protein with \u03b8-curve motif and provide a catalogue of possible \u03b8-curves in proteins.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper defines and classifies non-trivial \u03b8-curves in proteins, formed by covalent and ion-mediated interactions. The hypothesis is that these \u03b8-curves are not random occurrences but may have functional significance.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The authors identified 7 distinct non-trivial \u03b8-curve topologies in proteins. They found a correlation between the presence of \u03b8-curves and enzyme function, suggesting potential functional roles.  Analysis of a covalent \u03b8-curve protein showed that knot formation didn't correlate with the folding barrier, unlike main-chain knots.  A catalogue of possible \u03b8-curves was also generated, showing that new deterministic \u03b8-curves are unlikely to be found by simply introducing bridges.\n",
