Predicting mutational effects on protein-protein binding via a side-chain diffusion probabilistic model**\n\n1. **Title:** Predicting mutational effects on protein-protein binding via a side-chain diffusion probabilistic model\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to use a diffusion probabilistic model to predict how mutations affect protein-protein binding. The hypothesis is that a diffusion model, incorporating BLOSUM matrices and secondary structure information, can effectively model the probability distribution of amino acid sequences that maintain protein-protein binding.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The model (GRADE-IF) shows improved recovery rates for single-chain proteins and short sequences compared to several structure-aware baselines. It generates biologically plausible sequences, with higher recovery rates for conserved core residues than surface residues. The generated sequences exhibit high foldability and diversity.\n\n\n**2.

Revealing data leakage in protein interaction benchmarks**\n\n1. **Title:** Revealing data leakage in protein interaction benchmarks\n2. **Abstract:** In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in machine learning for protein\u2013protein interactions. However, prior work has predominantly focused on improving learning algorithms, with less attention paid to evaluation strategies and data preparation. Here, we demonstrate that further development of machine learning methods may be hindered by the quality of existing train-test splits. Specifically, we find that commonly used splitting strategies for protein complexes, based on protein sequence or metadata similarity, introduce major data leakage. This may result in overoptimistic evaluation of generalization, as well as unfair benchmarking of the models, biased towards assessing their overfitting capacity rather than practical utility. To overcome the data leakage, we recommend constructing data splits based on 3D structural similarity of protein\u2013protein interfaces and suggest corresponding algorithms. We believe that addressing the data leakage problem is critical for further progress in this research area.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate data leakage in commonly used benchmarks for protein-protein interaction prediction. The hypothesis is that existing splitting strategies based on metadata or sequence similarity lead to significant data leakage, hindering the accurate evaluation of model generalization.\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The authors demonstrate significant data leakage (up to 86%) in common splitting strategies (PDB code, PPI code, deposition time, sequence similarity). They advocate for splitting based on 3D structural similarity of protein-protein interfaces using methods like iDist to mitigate this issue.\n\n\n**8. Protein Language Model-Powered 3D Ligand Binding Site Prediction from Protein Sequence**\n\n1. **Title:** Protein Language Model-Powered 3D Ligand Binding Site Prediction from Protein Sequence\n2. **Abstract:** Prediction of ligand binding sites of proteins is a fundamental and important task for understanding the function of proteins and screening potential drugs. Most existing methods require experimentally determined protein holo-structures as input. However, such structures can be unavailable on novel or less-studied proteins. To tackle this limitation, we propose LaMPSite, which only takes protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input for ligand binding site predictions. The protein sequences are used to retrieve residue-level embeddings and contact maps from the pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model. The ligand molecular graphs are fed into a graph neural network to compute atom-level embeddings. Then we compute and update the protein-ligand interaction embedding based on the protein residue-level embeddings and ligand atom-level embeddings, and the geometric constraints in the inferred protein contact map and ligand distance map. A final pooling on protein-ligand interaction embedding would indicate which residues belong to the binding sites. Without any 3D coordinate information of proteins, our proposed model achieves competitive performance compared to baseline methods that require 3D protein structures when predicting binding sites. Given that less than 50% of proteins have reliable structure information in the current stage, LaMPSite will provide new opportunities for drug discovery.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to predict ligand binding sites using only protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs, bypassing the need for 3D protein structures. The hypothesis is that the residue-level embeddings and contact maps from a pre-trained protein language model (ESM-2), combined with ligand information from a graph neural network, can accurately predict binding sites.\n4. **Summary of Results:** LaMPSite achieves competitive performance compared to baselines requiring 3D protein structures, demonstrating the potential of using protein language models for binding site prediction without explicit 3D information.  It shows good accuracy in identifying binding sites in various examples.\n\n\n**9. Insight into the correlation between lag time and aggregation rate in the kinetics of protein aggregation**\n\n1. **Title:** Insight into the correlation between lag time and aggregation rate in the kinetics of protein aggregation\n2. **Abstract:** Under favourable conditions, many proteins can assemble into macroscopically large aggregates such as the amyloid fibrils that are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and other neurological and systemic diseases. The overall process of protein aggregation is characterized by initial lag time during which no detectable aggregation occurs in the solution and by maximal aggregation rate at which the dissolved protein converts into aggregates. In this study, the correlation between the lag time and the maximal rate of protein aggregation is analyzed. It is found that the product of these two quantities depends on a single numerical parameter, the kinetic index of the curve quantifying the time evolution of the fraction of protein aggregated. As this index depends relatively little on the conditions and/or system studied, our finding provides insight into why for many experiments the values of the product of the lag time and the maximal aggregation rate are often equal or quite close to each other. It is shown how the kinetic index is related to a basic kinetic parameter of a recently proposed theory of protein aggregation.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to analyze the correlation between the lag time and maximal aggregation rate in protein aggregation. The hypothesis is that the product of these two quantities is related to a single kinetic index, explaining the observed consistency in this product across different proteins and conditions.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors find that the product of lag time and maximal aggregation rate depends primarily on a kinetic index (n), which shows relatively little variation across different systems and conditions. This explains the observed consistency in this product despite variations in individual lag times and aggregation rates.  The kinetic index is linked to parameters in a previously proposed theory of protein aggregation.\n\n\n**10. Structure calculation strategies for membrane proteins; a comparison study**\n\n1. **Title:** Structure calculation strategies for membrane proteins; a comparison study\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided.\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to compare different structure calculation strategies for helical membrane proteins using sparse NMR data. The hypothesis is that utilizing a combination of canonical helix restraints, inter-helical NOEs, and residual dipolar couplings will lead to accurate structure predictions, potentially differing based on protein topology and size.\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study finds that for a homodimeric protein (GpA), a two-step method (independent helix folding followed by rigid-body refinement) is effective. However, for a more complex protein (aquaporin), a one-step method (simulated annealing from an extended conformation) is superior.  The use of canonical helix restraints and exhaustive inter-helical NOE assignments is generally recommended.  The authors highlight the importance of considering protein topology and size when choosing the best structure calculation strategy.\n\n\nNote:  Several papers had insufficient information provided to completely address all four points.  More complete papers would include a more detailed results section and a clearer statement of the hypothesis.\n",
