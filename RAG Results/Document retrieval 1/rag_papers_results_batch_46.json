The authors find that these surveys have significantly underestimated protein abundances and the relative importance of transcription.  Using individual measurements for 61 housekeeping proteins to rescale whole proteome data, they find that mRNA levels explain at least 56% of the differences in protein abundance, and potentially more.  A second independent strategy suggests mRNA levels explain ~81% of the variance in protein levels.  Both strategies suggest transcription plays a more important role than previously thought, and translation a much smaller role.  Finally, approximately 40% of genes in a given cell may express no mRNA, meaning translation rates play no role in determining their protein expression levels.\n\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to re-evaluate existing large-scale datasets on protein and mRNA abundances in mammalian cells to determine the relative contributions of transcription, mRNA degradation, translation, and protein degradation to overall protein expression levels. The authors hypothesize that previous studies have underestimated protein abundances and the importance of transcription due to systematic biases in measurement techniques and a failure to account for all sources of error.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors find significant underestimation of protein abundances in previous studies.  Their correction using individual protein measurements reveals a much higher median protein abundance (170,000 molecules/cell).  They demonstrate a stronger correlation between corrected protein abundances and mRNA levels than uncorrected data.  By accounting for measurement errors, they estimate mRNA levels explain at least 56% (and potentially more) of protein abundance variation.  An independent analysis using directly measured translation rates supports this, suggesting mRNA explains ~81% of the variance.  Both analyses indicate a greater role for transcription and a smaller role for translation than previously believed.  Finally, they estimate that ~40% of genes in a cell are not transcribed, further emphasizing the importance of transcription.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Configurational Entropy of Folded Proteins and its Importance for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins**\n\n1. **Title:** Configurational Entropy of Folded Proteins and its Importance for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the performance of various force fields (pairwise additive and many-body) in simulating both folded and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The hypothesis is that force fields that best capture the configurational entropy of folded proteins will also perform better in simulating IDPs, which are characterized by greater structural flexibility.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study compares several force fields' ability to simulate folded proteins, IDPs (Histatin 5), proteins with disordered regions (TSR4 domain), and a peptide undergoing a disorder-to-order transition ((AAQAA)3). They find that force fields allowing for larger fluctuations (consistent with experimental radius of gyration and Lindemann criteria for folded proteins) better describe the disordered systems.  The polarizable AMOEBA force field performs better than the fixed-charge force fields, demonstrating superior ability to capture both folded structures and the flexibility of disordered states. The study also highlights the importance of considering not only average helical content but also residue-specific helical propensities when evaluating force field performance on peptides with partial disorder.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Proteins \u2013 a celebration of consilience**\n\n1. **Title:** Proteins \u2013 a celebration of consilience\n\n2. **Abstract:** Proteins are the common constituents of all living cells. They are molecular machines that interact with each other as well as with other cell products and carry out a dizzying array of functions with distinction. These interactions follow from their native state structures and therefore understanding sequence-structure relationships is of fundamental importance. What is quite remarkable about proteins is that their understanding necessarily straddles several disciplines. The importance of geometry in defining protein native state structure, the constraints placed on protein behavior by mathematics and physics, the need for proteins to obey the laws of quantum chemistry, and the rich role of evolution and biology all come together in defining protein science. Here we review ideas from the literature and present an interdisciplinary framework that aims to marry ideas from Plato and Darwin and demonstrates an astonishing consilience between disciplines in describing proteins. We discuss the consequences of this framework on protein behavior.\n\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to present a unified interdisciplinary framework for understanding proteins, integrating mathematical, physical, chemical, and biological perspectives. The central hypothesis is that the fundamental building blocks of protein structures (\u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets) are determined by geometric constraints derived from mathematics and physics, and that biological evolution works within these pre-defined structural constraints.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper uses a minimalist tube model to derive the geometries of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets using only the bond length as input and no chemical information. The predicted geometries are shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental data from a large dataset of protein structures.  The authors argue that this demonstrates a remarkable consilience between mathematical/physical predictions and experimental observations.  They further discuss the roles of chemistry and biology in shaping protein function and evolution, emphasizing that evolution acts on sequences and functions within the constraints of the pre-determined structural library.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Topological complexity, contact order and protein folding rates**\n\n1. **Title:** Topological complexity, contact order and protein folding rates\n\n2. **Abstract:** Not provided in excerpt.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the relationship between protein folding rates and the contact order (CO) parameter, which reflects the spatial arrangement of amino acid contacts in the native protein structure.  The hypothesis is that higher contact order (indicating more long-range interactions) will correlate with slower folding rates.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Monte Carlo simulations of protein folding show a strong correlation between contact order and folding time for longer chains (N \u2265 54) with higher contact order (CO > 0.17).  For shorter chains, no such correlation is observed. The results suggest that for proteins with predominantly non-local contacts, the difficulty in escaping kinetic traps due to local energy minima leads to slower folding. This is consistent with experimental data showing a correlation between CO and folding times, particularly strong for longer proteins.  The authors suggest that lattice models with local moves can capture key aspects of real protein folding dynamics.\n\n",
