Title:** LEARNING TO DESIGN PROTEIN\u2013PROTEIN INTERACTIONS WITH ENHANCED GENERALIZATION\n\n**Abstract:** Discovering mutations enhancing protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) is critical for advancing biomedical research and developing improved therapeutics. While machine learning approaches have substantially advanced the field, they often struggle to generalize beyond training data in practical scenarios. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we construct PPIRef, the largest and non-redundant dataset of 3D protein\u2013protein interactions, enabling effective large-scale learning. Second, we leverage the PPIRef dataset to pre-train PPIformer, a new SE(3)-equivariant model generalizing across diverse protein-binder variants. We fine-tune PPIformer to predict effects of mutations on protein\u2013protein interactions via a thermodynamically motivated adjustment of the pre-training loss function. Finally, we demonstrate the enhanced generalization of our new PPIformer approach by outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on new, non-leaking splits of standard labeled PPI mutational data and independent case studies optimizing a human antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and increasing the thrombolytic activity of staphylokinase.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:**  The paper hypothesizes that by creating a larger, non-redundant dataset of protein-protein interactions (PPIRef) and training a more robust, SE(3)-equivariant model (PPIformer) with a thermodynamically-informed loss function, they can improve the generalization ability of machine learning models for predicting the effects of mutations on PPI binding affinity (\u2206\u2206G).  This improved generalization will allow for more accurate design of protein binders in real-world applications.\n\n**Summary of Results:**  The authors created PPIRef, a significantly larger and less redundant dataset of protein-protein interactions than previously available.  They developed PPIformer, a new SE(3)-equivariant model, and pre-trained it on PPIRef.  Fine-tuning on SKEMPI v2.0 and testing on non-leaking splits showed PPIformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting \u2206\u2206G.  Further, PPIformer demonstrated superior performance in independent case studies involving antibody design and enzyme engineering.\n\n\n**2. Title:** Protein corona composition of PEGylated nanoparticles correlates strongly with amino acid composition of protein surface\n\n**Abstract:** (Provided in the text) Extensive molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the interactions between proteins and poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG) can be described in terms of the surface composition of the proteins. PEG molecules accumulate around non-polar residues while avoiding polar ones. A solvent-accessible-surface-area model of protein adsorption on PEGylated nanoparticles accurately fits a large set of data on the composition of the protein corona recently obtained by label-free proteomic mass spectrometry.\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The paper hypothesizes that the composition of the protein corona formed on PEGylated nanoparticles is strongly correlated with the amino acid composition of the protein surface, specifically that PEG will preferentially interact with hydrophobic residues.  This hypothesis is tested using molecular dynamics simulations and a solvent-accessible surface area model.\n\n**Summary of Results:** Molecular dynamics simulations showed non-uniform PEG distribution on protein surfaces, with accumulation around non-polar residues.  A simple model relating protein adsorption to solvent-accessible surface area and residue-specific PEG affinity accurately predicted protein corona composition from experimental mass spectrometry data, supporting the hypothesis. The model reveals that hydrophobic residues favor PEG interaction, while negatively charged residues repel it.\n\n\n**3. Title:**  (No title provided, but excerpt suggests a study on protein evolution)\n\n**Abstract:** (Not available)\n\n**Main idea and hypothesis:** The excerpt explores protein evolution as a complex system, hypothesizing that its dynamics are governed by principles of complex systems theory, including nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, self-organization, and emergence of order from chaos.  The interplay between mutational \"turbulence\" and selective pressures shapes evolutionary trajectories, leading to the emergence of stable folds and functions.\n\n**Summary of Results:** The excerpt does not present specific results but argues that protein evolution exhibits characteristics of complex systems, such as turbulence, strange attractors (stable folds/functions), and fractal-like branching of evolutionary trees.  It suggests that machine learning, coupled with tools from complex systems theory (bandit theory, phase space analysis), can improve the modeling and prediction of evolutionary trajectories.  The limitations of current machine learning approaches, such as overstating the understanding of evolutionary patterns, are also discussed.\n\n\nThe remaining excerpts are for individual methods or datasets mentioned in the first paper, and don't represent complete papers themselves.  Therefore, I cannot provide summaries for them.\n",
