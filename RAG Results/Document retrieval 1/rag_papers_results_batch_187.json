Note that some sections may be incomplete due to missing information in the provided excerpts.\n\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** One way to characterize the compact structures of lattice protein model\n\n2. **Abstract:**  On the study of protein folding, our understanding about the protein structures is limited. In this paper we find one way to characterize the compact structures of lattice protein model. A quantity called Partnum is given to each compact structure. The Partnum is compared with the concept Designability of protein structures emerged recently. It is shown that the highly designable structures have, on average, an atypical number of local degree of freedom. The statistical property of Partnum and its dependence on sequence length is also studied.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a new method to characterize the compact structures of lattice protein models without explicitly considering the details of interactions. The hypothesis is that the properties of protein structures, rather than the details of interactions, primarily determine whether a protein will be thermodynamically stable, fold quickly, and be resistant to mutations. This is based on the existing literature suggesting that highly designable structures (those that can be formed by many different sequences) possess these desirable properties.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors introduce \"Partnum,\" a quantity assigned to each compact structure based on a simple search algorithm.  They find a correlation between Partnum and Designability, suggesting that structures with higher Partnums are more designable.  Statistically, the distribution of Partnums becomes more normal as chain length increases, implying that in the long-chain limit, the differences between compact structures become less significant. This aligns with the observation that it's increasingly difficult to find ground state candidates for longer protein sequences.  The authors conclude that the statistical properties of protein structures, not interaction details, largely determine a protein's ability to fulfill biological functions.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** An effective all-atom potential for proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:**  (Not provided in excerpt)\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a computationally efficient, implicit-solvent, all-atom potential for protein simulations that accurately captures the folding and aggregation behavior of proteins. The hypothesis is that a single set of parameters for this potential can be used to accurately model the behavior of a wide range of peptides and proteins, capturing their structural and thermodynamic properties.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors present and test their implicit solvent all-atom potential on 20 peptide/protein systems (17 peptides with 10-37 residues and 3 larger proteins with 49-67 residues). The potential successfully folds these diverse sequences to structures similar to their experimentally determined structures using a single parameter set.  The authors note that while the model captures many experimentally observed stability differences, the apparent folded population of small peptides is probe-dependent (i.e., depends on the observable used). The model also successfully simulates the folding of larger proteins, including a three-helix bundle and a heterodimeric leucine zipper.  The computational efficiency of the potential allows for extensive sampling of conformational space.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** About the Protein Space Vastness\n\n2. **Abstract:** An accurate estimation of the Protein Space size, in light of the factors that govern it, is a long-standing problem and of paramount importance in evolutionary biology, since it determines the nature of protein evolvability. A simple analysis will enable us to, firstly, reduce an unrealistic Protein Space size of ~10130 sequences, for a 100-residues polypeptide chain, to ~109 functional proteins and, secondly, estimate a robust average-mutation rate per amino acid (\uf078 ~1.23) and infer from it, in light of the protein marginal stability, that only a fraction of the sequence will be available at any one time for a functional protein to evolve. Although this result does not solve the Protein Space vastness problem, frames it in a more rational one.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper aims to provide a more realistic estimation of the size of protein sequence space (Protein Space) by considering the constraints imposed by protein marginal stability. The hypothesis is that the size of the functional protein space is significantly smaller than naive combinatorial estimates due to the limited number of mutations a protein can tolerate while maintaining its functionality and stability.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The author argues that a naive combinatorial estimate of the protein space size (20^100 for a 100-residue protein) is unrealistic. By considering a protein's marginal stability (the small energy difference between the folded and unfolded states) and the rate of neutral mutations, the author estimates a more reasonable size of ~10^9 functional proteins for a 100-residue protein.  This implies an average mutation rate per amino acid of approximately 1.23. The author concludes that only a fraction of a protein's sequence is variable at any given time, consistent with the idea that marginal stability limits protein evolvability.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Energy-based Graph Convolutional Networks for Scoring Protein Docking Models\n\n2. **Abstract:** Structural information about protein-protein interactions, often missing at the interactome scale, is important for mechanistic understanding of cells and rational discovery of therapeutics. Protein docking provides a computational alternative to predict such information. However, ranking near-native docked models high among a large number of candidates, often known as the scoring problem, remains a critical challenge. Moreover, estimating model quality, also known as the quality assessment problem, is rarely addressed in protein docking. In this study the two challenging problems in protein docking are regarded as relative and absolute scoring, respectively, and addressed in one physics-inspired deep learning framework. We represent proteins and encounter complexes as intra- and inter-molecular residue contact graphs with atom-resolution node and edge features. And we propose a novel graph convolutional kernel that pool interacting nodes\u2019 features through edge features so that generalized interaction energies can be learned directly from graph data. The resulting energy-based graph convolutional networks (EGCN) with multi-head attention are trained to predict intra- and inter-molecular energies, binding affinities, and quality measures (interface RMSD) for encounter complexes. Compared to a state-of-the-art scoring function for model ranking, EGCN has significantly improved ranking for a CAPRI test set involving homology docking; and is comparable for Score_set, a CAPRI benchmark set generated by diverse community-wide docking protocols not known to training data. For Score_set quality assessment, EGCN shows about 27% improvement to our previous efforts. Directly learning from structure data in graph representation, EGCN represents the first successful development of graph convolutional networks for protein docking.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a deep learning framework using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to improve the accuracy of protein-protein docking scoring functions.  The hypothesis is that a physics-inspired GCN, learning directly from structural data represented as graphs, will outperform existing methods that rely on hand-engineered features or less sophisticated machine learning models for both ranking (relative scoring) and quality assessment (absolute scoring) of docking models.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors develop an energy-based GCN (EGCN) model to predict binding energies and quality (interface RMSD) of protein-protein docking models.  EGCN significantly outperforms a random forest model and a state-of-the-art scoring function (IRAD) in ranking near-native models, particularly for homology docking.  EGCN also shows a substantial improvement in quality estimation compared to the random forest model, even on a benchmark dataset with diverse docking protocols not seen during training.  The authors conclude that directly learning from structural data using GCNs represents a more accurate and robust approach to protein docking scoring.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** How does a protein reach its binding locus: sliding along DNA chain or not?\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not explicitly provided, but implied by the introduction)\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The paper investigates the mechanism by which proteins (like RNA polymerase or transcription factors) find their target loci on a DNA chain. The hypothesis is that the efficiency of this search process depends on a combination of 3D diffusion in the cell and 1D sliding along the DNA, and that the relative contribution of each mode is determined by factors like diffusion constants, binding/unbinding rates, and the distance to the target.  Previous studies suggested that 1D sliding significantly enhances efficiency, but recent experiments contradict this.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Using a chain-space coupled model (2D lattice for the cell, 1D lattice for DNA), the authors analyze the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a protein to reach its target. They find a critical value for the 1D diffusion constant (D1).  Below this value, 1D sliding hinders the search; above it, sliding enhances efficiency.  The MFPT is also shown to increase with the distance between the protein's initial position and the target locus but not monotonically with the distance to the DNA chain.  The probability of direct binding (without intermediate 1D sliding) increases with the 2D diffusion constant and decreases with the 1D diffusion constant.  The results suggest that the search mechanism depends on both the cellular environment and protein properties.\n",
