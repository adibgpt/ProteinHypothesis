However, current models are either difficult to direct to produce a protein from a specific family of interest, or must be trained on a large multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from the specific family of interest, making them unable to benefit from transfer learning across families. To address this, we propose Protein Evolutionary Transformer (PoET), an autoregressive generative model of whole protein families that learns to generate sets of related proteins as sequences-of-sequences across tens of millions of natural protein sequence clusters. PoET can be used as a retrieval-augmented language model to generate and score arbitrary modifications conditioned on any protein family of interest, and can extrapolate from short context lengths to generalize well even for small families. This is enabled by a unique Transformer layer; we model tokens sequentially within sequences while attending between sequences order invariantly, allowing PoET to scale to context lengths beyond those used during training. In extensive experiments on deep mutational scanning datasets, we show that PoET outperforms existing protein language models and evolutionary sequence models for variant function prediction across proteins of all MSA depths. We also demonstrate PoET\u2019s ability to controllably generate new protein sequences.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a generative model (PoET) that can predict protein variant fitness and generate novel protein sequences from specific families, overcoming limitations of existing models which either struggle with family-specific generation or lack the ability to transfer learning across families.  The hypothesis is that modeling protein families as \"sequences-of-sequences\" within a novel Transformer architecture will allow for better generalization across families, efficient inference, and the ability to generate sequences with novel indels.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** PoET outperforms existing methods for protein variant fitness prediction across various deep mutational scanning datasets, showing improvement for both substitutions and indels, especially in proteins with low MSA depth.  PoET also demonstrates the ability to generate novel, structurally conserved protein sequences belonging to specific families, showcasing its capacity for controlled protein design.  A key architectural feature enabling this is the novel \"TieredTransformerDecoderLayer,\" which allows for extrapolation to context lengths much longer than those used during training.\n\n\n**Paper 2:  MSA-to-protein transformer**\n\n1. **Title:** FEW-SHOT PROTEIN GENERATION\n\n2. **Abstract:** We present the MSA-to-protein transformer, a generative model of protein sequences conditioned on protein families represented by multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Unlike existing approaches to learning generative models of protein families, the MSA-to-protein transformer conditions sequence generation directly on a learned encoding of the multiple sequence alignment, circumventing the need for fitting dedicated family models. By training on a large set of well-curated multiple sequence alignments in Pfam, our MSA-to-protein transformer generalizes well to protein families not observed during training and outperforms conventional family modeling approaches, especially when MSAs are small. Our generative approach accurately models epistasis and indels and allows for exact inference and efficient sampling unlike other approaches. We demonstrate the protein sequence modeling capabilities of our MSA-to-protein transformer and compare it with alternative sequence modeling approaches in comprehensive benchmark experiments.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a generative model that can predict protein sequences conditioned on a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) representing a protein family, avoiding the need for separate model training for each family. The hypothesis is that a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture can effectively learn the relationships between MSAs and protein sequences, enabling few-shot generation and accurate prediction of variant function, including epistasis and indels.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The MSA-to-protein transformer (MSA2Prot) significantly outperforms PSSMs and profile HMMs in predicting unseen protein sequences from small MSAs.  It achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep mutational scanning datasets for both point mutations and indels, significantly better than existing methods for higher-order mutants due to its ability to model epistasis. The model also demonstrates effective adaptive sampling, generating high-fitness variants even with limited fitness data.\n\n\n**Paper 3: ProTranslator: zero-shot protein function prediction using textual description**\n\n1. **Title:** ProTranslator: zero-shot protein function prediction using textual description\n\n2. **Abstract:** Accurately finding proteins and genes that have a certain function is the prerequisite for a broad range of biomedical applications. Despite the encouraging progress of existing computational approaches in protein function prediction, it remains challenging to annotate proteins to a novel function that is not collected in the Gene Ontology and does not have any annotated proteins. This limitation, a \u201cside effect\u201d from the widely-used multi-label classification problem setting of protein function prediction, hampers the progress of studying new pathways and biological processes, and further slows down research in various biomedical areas. Here, we tackle this problem by annotating proteins to a function only based on its textual description so that we don\u2019t need to know any associated proteins for this function. The key idea of our method ProTranslator is to redefine protein function prediction as a machine translation problem, which translates the description word sequence of a function to the amino acid sequence of a protein. We can then transfer annotations from functions that have similar textual description to annotate a novel function. We observed substantial improvement in annotating novel functions and sparsely annotated functions on CAFA3, SwissProt and GOA datasets. We further demonstrated how our method accurately predicted gene members for a given pathway in Reactome, KEGG and MSigDB only based on the pathway description. Finally, we showed how ProTranslator enabled us to generate the textual description instead of the function label for a set of proteins, providing a new scheme for protein function prediction. We envision ProTranslator will give rise to a protein function \u201csearch engine\u201d that returns a list of proteins based on the free text queried by the user.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to predict protein function using only the textual description of the function, bypassing the need for known annotated proteins for that function. The hypothesis is that  reframing protein function prediction as a machine translation problem, leveraging a pre-trained language model (PubMedBert) to embed textual descriptions, and integrating protein sequence, description, and network features will enable accurate zero-shot and few-shot prediction of protein function, including novel functions and pathways.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** ProTranslator significantly outperforms comparison methods (TF-IDF and a graph-based approach) in zero-shot protein function prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of using textual descriptions. It also shows substantial improvement over DeepGOPlus in few-shot settings, particularly for sparsely annotated functions.  ProTranslator successfully predicts gene members of pathways using only pathway descriptions, and can generate textual descriptions for sets of proteins, suggesting potential for automated GO curation.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Effect of Dielectric Properties of Ceramic-Solvent Interface on the Binding of Protein to Oxide Ceramics: a Non Local Electrostatic Approach**\n\n1. **Title:** Effect of Dielectric Properties of Ceramic-Solvent Interface on the Binding of Protein to Oxide Ceramics: a Non Local Electrostatic Approach\n\n2. **Abstract:** (Not fully provided, but inferred from the introduction and methods) The paper investigates the effect of the dielectric constant of ceramic implant materials on protein adsorption in an aqueous environment, using a non-local electrostatic model that accounts for the structured interfacial water layer.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to determine how the dielectric constant of ceramic implant materials affects the electrostatic contribution to protein binding, considering the influence of a dynamically ordered interfacial water layer. The hypothesis is that the non-local electrostatic model, accounting for the reduced dielectric constant of the interfacial water, will predict a more favorable (attractive) electrostatic interaction between proteins and ceramic surfaces than the classical (local) model.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The study shows that the non-local electrostatic model predicts a significantly stronger attractive electrostatic interaction between proteins and ceramic surfaces compared to the classical model.  The electrostatic binding energy depends non-monotonically on the ceramic dielectric constant (\u03b5C), with moderate values (below or around 35) being most favorable. This suggests that ceramic materials with moderate \u03b5C, such as ZrO2, could be beneficial for enhancing protein-implant binding.\n",
