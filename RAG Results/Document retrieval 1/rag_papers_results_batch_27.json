Note that some sections are omitted where the provided text does not contain the requested information.\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** Integrating Protein Sequence and Expression Level to Analysis Molecular Characterization of Breast Cancer Subtypes\n\n2. **Abstract:** This study integrates protein sequence data with expression levels to improve the molecular characterization of breast cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. Using ProtGPT2, embeddings capturing protein sequence properties were integrated with expression levels. Ensemble K-means and XGBoost were used for clustering and classification.  High F1 scores (0.88 for survival, 0.87 for biomarkers) were achieved. Key proteins (KMT2C, GCN1, CLASP2) linked to hormone receptors and HER2 were highlighted.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that integrating protein sequence data (providing structural and functional information) with protein expression levels (providing quantitative abundance information) will improve the accuracy of breast cancer subtype classification and prediction of clinical outcomes compared to using expression data alone.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The integrated approach successfully clustered patients into biologically distinct groups and accurately predicted clinical outcomes (survival and biomarker status).  Analysis of feature importance identified key proteins like KMT2C, GCN1, and CLASP2,  and correlation and protein-protein interaction network analyses revealed interdependence among these proteins.  XGBoost achieved the best classification performance.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Flexibility of \u03b1-helices: Results of a statistical analysis of database protein structures\n\n2. **Abstract:** \u03b1-helices, though common, are not rigid. This study quantifies \u03b1-helix flexibility using principal component analysis (PCA) on helices of different lengths from the Protein Data Bank. Three dominant modes were found: two bend modes and one twist mode, consistent with independent Gaussian distributions.  Eigenvalues scale with helix length (bend ~L<sup>4</sup>, twist ~L<sup>2</sup>), reproduced by a simple spring model.  The flexibility is applied to coiled-coil proteins.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that a statistical analysis of \u03b1-helices from a large database of protein structures will reveal dominant modes of flexibility that can be modeled by a simple physical model, and that these modes will be relevant to understanding the structure of coiled-coil proteins.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** PCA revealed three dominant flexible modes (two bends, one twist) whose eigenvalues scaled predictably with helix length. A simple spring model, incorporating hydrogen bonding and excluded volume, accurately reproduced these modes and their scaling. Analysis of coiled-coil proteins showed that their helix deformations were primarily explained by these modes, with longer helices requiring higher-order bend harmonics.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** Computational reconstruction of mitochondria-encoded mammal ancestral proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:** A method based on mapping symbolic sequences into patterns is proposed for ancestral sequence reconstruction. The method uses the most frequent patterns from a set of related protein sequences to infer the ancestral sequence. No sequence alignment or phylogenetic tree is needed. The method was applied to thirteen mitochondrial-encoded protein families, revealing statistical distributions of similarity between extant and ancestral sequences, suggesting relationships to past environmental changes.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that the most frequent patterns (words) found in a set of extant protein sequences from a given family are likely to be conserved from an ancestral sequence, and therefore, concatenating these frequent patterns can reconstruct a reasonable approximation of the ancestral protein sequence.  This method avoids the need for traditional alignment and phylogenetic tree construction.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The method successfully inferred ancestral amino acid sequences for thirteen mitochondrial-encoded protein families.  Analysis of the similarity distributions between extant and ancestral sequences revealed structure related to potential past environmental changes, with multiple periods of high population density for some protein families.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** Polymeric Assembly of Gluten Proteins in an Aqueous Ethanol Solvent\n\n2. **Abstract:** This study investigates the supramolecular organization of wheat gluten proteins using X-ray scattering and light scattering techniques. A gluten extract enriched in glutenin was used, dispersed in a water/ethanol mixture.  The proteins behaved as flexible polymer chains in a good solvent, forming loose structures in dilute solutions and a hierarchical structure with large-scale heterogeneities in concentrated solutions, similar to polymeric gels.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The hypothesis is that gluten proteins, when appropriately solubilized, will exhibit structural and dynamical properties consistent with flexible polymer chains in a good solvent, and that this behavior will explain the viscoelastic properties of gluten gels.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** In dilute solutions, gluten proteins formed loose, branched structures with dynamics similar to branched polymer coils. In concentrated solutions, a hierarchical structure was observed, with a correlation length scaling consistent with semi-dilute polymer solutions and large-scale heterogeneities characteristic of polymeric gels.  The results support the model of gluten gels as polymeric networks.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** Ligand Binding, Protein Fluctuations, And Allosteric Free Energy\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper explores the role of protein fluctuations in allosteric effects using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (Dx) between protein conformational distributions before and after ligand binding.  Previous applications of Dx in protein analysis and simulation are reviewed. The paper proposes that kBTDx represents an allosteric free energy and develops a thermodynamic model of allosteric transitions.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The central hypothesis is that the Kullback-Leibler divergence (Dx) between protein conformational distributions before and after ligand binding can serve as a quantitative measure of allosteric effects, and that this measure can be used to develop a thermodynamic framework for understanding allosteric transitions.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The paper reviews previous work showing Dx's utility in optimizing coarse-grained models and predicting ligand-binding sites.  It then introduces a thermodynamic interpretation of Dx as an allosteric free energy, providing a model that unifies different views of allosteric coupling.  Mathematical relationships between Dx, total free energy change, and ligand-binding affinities are derived.  The framework is applied to model the thermodynamics of a molecular engine.\n",
