They propose a new approach based on the idea that proteins are self-organized networks exhibiting finite-scale criticality.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is that protein structure and function are determined by long-range hydrophobic interactions within a self-organized, critically balanced network, rather than solely by short-range interactions captured by classical force fields (CFF).  The hypothesis is that a dimensionless, long-range hydrophobicity scale will better predict protein structure and function than existing scales.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors tested three hydrophobicity scales (Kyte-Doolittle, Pintar, and Zebende) on two proteins (GA and GB) and their mutants. The Zebende scale, based on self-organized criticality and scaling of solvent accessible surface area (SASA), showed the best correlation with experimental data on protein stability and binding function.  The results suggest that protein structure, dynamics, and function are best understood without relying on CFFs, and that large-scale hydrophobic patterns are crucial for function.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Understanding Functional Protein-Protein Interactions of ABCB11 and ADA in Human and Mouse**\n\n1. **Title:** Understanding Functional Protein-Protein Interactions of ABCB11 and ADA in Human and Mouse\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper aims to quantitatively understand protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of ABCB11 and ADA in humans and mice, focusing on factors regulating these interactions and comparing them across species.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is to apply quantitative methods to analyze the DNA and protein sequences of ABCB11 and ADA and their interacting partners to identify factors governing their PPIs and to compare these interactions across human and mouse. The hypothesis is that quantitative measures derived from sequence analysis and biophysical properties will reveal commonalities and differences in the PPIs of these proteins across species.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  The authors used several quantitative measures (fractal dimension of indicator matrices and DNA walks, poly-string mean and standard deviation, biophysical properties, and protein structural properties) to characterize the DNA and protein sequences of ABCB11, ADA, and their interacting partners. They found that certain genes and proteins show similar quantitative characteristics in both species, while others are species-specific.  The analysis suggests that quantitative measures can reveal relationships between the genes/proteins and their biological functions and provide a comparative view of PPIs across species.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Magnetic Noise Enabled Biocompass**\n\n1. **Title:** Magnetic Noise Enabled Biocompass\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The authors propose a microscopic mechanism for magnetoreception in birds, suggesting that magnetic field fluctuations, rather than permanent magnetism, in a magnetic protein (MagR) enable geomagnetic field sensing.\n\n3. **Main Idea and Hypothesis:** The main idea is that the magnetic fluctuations in the MagR protein, caused by its electron spin bath, are responsible for the singlet-triplet conversion in a radical pair, enabling magnetoreception. The hypothesis is that this fluctuation-based mechanism, rather than relying on a net magnetization of the MagR, explains the biocompass function.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  A model of a radical pair interacting with an electron spin bath (MagR) was developed and analyzed.  The results show that the singlet fidelity of the radical pair is sensitive to the geomagnetic field direction due to the magnetic fluctuations generated by the MagR. Two key conditions for optimal sensitivity were identified: resonance between power spectrum peaks of the MagR and singlet-triplet transition frequencies, and non-degeneracy of triplet states.  The study highlights the importance of magnetic noise and quantum coherence in the biocompass mechanism.\n\n\n**Paper 4: A Constant Force Probe Based on GFP Polyprotein Unfolding**\n\nThis paper's full text is not provided, only some tables and figures and a partial abstract.
