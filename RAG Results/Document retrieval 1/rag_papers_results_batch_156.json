Note that some sections may be incomplete due to missing abstracts or insufficient detail in the provided text.\n\n\n**Paper 1:**\n\n1. **Title:** Reprogramming Pretrained Language Models for Protein Sequence Representation Learning\n\n2. **Abstract:** Machine Learning-guided solutions for protein learning tasks have made significant headway in recent years. However, success in scientific discovery tasks is limited by the accessibility of well-defined and labeled in-domain data. To tackle the low-data constraint, recent adaptions of deep learning models pretrained on millions of protein sequences have shown promise; however, the construction of such domain-specific large-scale model is computationally expensive. Here, we propose Representation Learning via Dictionary Learning (R2DL), an end-to-end representation learning framework in which we reprogram deep models for alternate-domain tasks that can perform well on protein property prediction with significantly fewer training samples. R2DL reprograms a pretrained English language model to learn the embeddings of protein sequences, by learning a sparse linear mapping between English and protein sequence vocabulary embeddings. Our model can attain better accuracy and significantly improve the data efficiency by up to 105 times over the baselines set by pretrained and standard supervised methods. To this end, we reprogram an off-the-shelf pre-trained English language transformer and benchmark it on a set of protein physicochemical prediction tasks (secondary structure, stability, homology, stability) as well as on a biomedically relevant set of protein function prediction tasks (antimicrobial, toxicity, antibody affinity).\n\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a computationally inexpensive and accurate method for protein property prediction using transfer learning.  The hypothesis is that a pretrained English language model can be effectively repurposed to learn protein sequence representations, outperforming methods that require large-scale pretraining on protein data.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** R2DL, a dictionary learning framework, reprograms a pretrained English language model (BERT) to predict protein properties.  It consistently outperforms both pretrained and standard supervised methods across seven tasks (secondary structure, stability, homology, solubility, antimicrobial nature, toxicity, antibody affinity), achieving up to 11% improvement in stability prediction and up to 3.2% in antibody affinity.  R2DL is estimated to be over 10<sup>5</sup> times more data-efficient than existing pretraining methods, demonstrating robustness even with reduced training data.  The learned embeddings show interpretable relationships with protein properties and evolutionary distances.\n\n\n**Paper 2:**\n\n1. **Title:** Random close packing in protein cores\n\n2. **Abstract:** Shortly after the determination of the first protein x-ray crystal structures, researchers analyzed their cores and reported packing fractions \u03c6 \u22480.75, a value that is similar to close packing equal-sized spheres. A limitation of these analyses was the use of \u2018extended atom\u2019 models, rather than the more physically accurate \u2018explicit hydrogen\u2019 model. The validity of using the explicit hydrogen model is proved by its ability to predict the side chain dihedral angle distributions observed in proteins. We employ the explicit hydrogen model to calculate the packing fraction of the cores of over 200 high resolution protein structures. We find that these protein cores have \u03c6 \u22480.55, which is comparable to random close-packing of non-spherical particles. This result provides a deeper understanding of the physical basis of protein structure that will enable predictions of the effects of amino acid mutations and design of new functional proteins.\n\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to re-evaluate the packing fraction of protein cores using a more accurate atomic model (explicit hydrogen) instead of the previously used extended atom model. The hypothesis is that the explicit hydrogen model will yield a lower packing fraction, more consistent with random close packing of non-spherical particles rather than close packing of spheres.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Using the explicit hydrogen model on 221 high-resolution protein structures, the average packing fraction of protein cores was found to be approximately 0.55, significantly lower than the previously reported value of 0.75 obtained using the extended atom model. This value is consistent with random close packing of non-spherical particles.  The explicit hydrogen model also accurately reproduces observed side chain dihedral angle distributions, further validating its accuracy.  The revised packing fraction is expected to improve predictions of mutation effects and aid in protein design.\n\n\n**Paper 3:**\n\n1. **Title:** MineProt: modern application for custom protein curation\n\n2. **Abstract:** AI systems represented by AlphaFold are rapidly expanding the scale of protein structure modelling data, and the MineProt project provides an effective solution for custom curation of these novel high-throughput data. It enables researchers to build their own protein server in simple steps, run almost out-of-the-box scripts to annotate and curate their proteins, visualize, browse and search their data via a user-friendly online interface, and utilize plugins to extend the functionality of server. It is expected to support researcher productivity and facilitate data sharing in the new era of structural proteomics.\n\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a user-friendly and easily deployable platform for curating and analyzing the large amounts of protein structure data generated by AI prediction tools like AlphaFold. The hypothesis is that providing researchers with a simplified, customizable server will improve their productivity and facilitate data sharing within the structural proteomics field.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** MineProt, an open-source project, provides a server-client architecture for custom protein server creation.  It features a user-friendly web interface for searching, visualizing (using Mol*), and analyzing protein structures, as well as a toolkit for annotation, data import, and format conversion.  MineProt utilizes Elasticsearch for searching and US-align for structure alignment.  Plugins allow for extending functionality (e.g., BLAST integration). The system is designed to handle large-scale data efficiently and facilitate data sharing.\n\n\n**Paper 4:**\n\n1. **Title:** CABS-flex predictions of protein flexibility compared with NMR ensembles\n\n2. **Abstract:** Identi\ufb01cation of \ufb02exible regions of protein structures is important for understanding of their biological functions. Recently, we have developed a fast approach for predicting protein structure \ufb02uctuations from a single protein model: the cabs-\ufb02ex. cabs-\ufb02ex was shown to be an e\ufb03cient alternative to conventional all-atom molecular dynamics (md). In this work, we evaluate cabs-\ufb02ex and md predictions by comparison with protein structural variations within nmr ensembles.\n\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to compare the accuracy of a fast protein flexibility prediction method (CABS-flex) with conventional all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, using NMR ensembles as a benchmark. The hypothesis is that CABS-flex will provide comparable or better predictions of protein flexibility than MD, while being significantly faster.\n\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** CABS-flex predictions of protein residue fluctuations were found to be well-correlated with those from NMR ensembles, with a stronger correlation than that observed between MD simulations and NMR ensembles.  This suggests that CABS-flex is a useful and computationally efficient alternative to MD for predicting protein flexibility, particularly in regions with high conformational change.  The authors note a tendency for underestimation of flexibility in NMR ensembles, which can affect the accuracy of comparisons.\n\n\n**Paper 5:**\n\n1. **Title:** Model of protein fragments and statistical potentials\n\n2. **Abstract:**  (Not provided in excerpt)\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a model of protein free energy based on bioinformatics data, using statistical potentials for short protein fragments. The hypothesis is that this approach, focusing on the statistics of short fragments and their conformations, can provide insights into protein folding, dynamics, and structural alignment, potentially overcoming limitations of traditional physics-based approaches.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The paper proposes a model of protein free energy as a sum of statistical potentials for short fragments, considering both fragment conformations and contacts between fragments. A hierarchical analysis of fragment occurrence frequencies is used to incorporate longer-range interactions.  This model is applied to protein folding (as a combinatorial optimization problem), proposing a hierarchical and greedy search algorithm.  A modified threading method is also suggested, incorporating fragment statistical potentials. The model emphasizes the use of bioinformatics data and discrete representations to handle the complexity of protein systems.\n",
