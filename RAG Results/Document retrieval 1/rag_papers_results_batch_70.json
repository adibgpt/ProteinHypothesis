Protein structures are known to be formed of domains; structural and functional subunits that are often repeated across sets of proteins.  This paper presents a tool for performing modular decomposition using the Infomap community detection algorithm. The decomposition obtained correlates well with existing PFAM sequence classifications, but has the advantage of spanning the full protein, with the potential for novel domains. The coarse-grained network formed by the communities can also be used as a proxy for protein topology at the single-chain level.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to use community detection in protein structure networks to identify structural domains, offering an alternative to existing methods that focus on conserved regions. The hypothesis is that the highly interconnected regions identified by Infomap will correspond well to existing domain annotations (like PFAM and SCOPe) and that the arrangement of these communities will reflect protein topology and be linked to function.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The Infomap-based method successfully decomposes protein structures into modules that correlate significantly with PFAM domain annotations. The method outperforms a previous modularity-based approach.  Furthermore, grouping proteins based on their coarse-grained network topology (derived from the community structure) yields a functionally significant classification, as measured by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis.  The approach is scalable and can be applied to large datasets.\n\n\n**Paper 2: Generalized Protein Pocket Generation with Prior-Informed Flow Matching**\n\n1. **Title:** Generalized Protein Pocket Generation with Prior-Informed Flow Matching\n\n2. **Abstract:** Designing ligand-binding proteins is essential in bioengineering and protein biology. Current approaches to pocket generation often suffer from time-intensive physical computations or template-based methods, as well as compromised generation quality due to the overlooking of domain knowledge.  This paper proposes PocketFlow, a generative model that incorporates protein-ligand interaction priors based on flow matching.  Extensive experiments show that PocketFlow outperforms baselines on multiple benchmarks, achieving an average improvement in Vina Score and scRMSD.  Moreover, modeling interactions makes PocketFlow a generalized generative model across multiple ligand modalities.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a generative model (PocketFlow) for protein pocket design that incorporates prior knowledge of protein-ligand interactions to improve the quality and efficiency of pocket generation. The hypothesis is that explicitly modeling interactions (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, etc.) within a flow matching framework will lead to higher-affinity and more structurally valid pockets compared to existing methods, and that this approach will generalize across different ligand types.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** PocketFlow outperforms baseline methods (DEPACT, RFDiffusionAA, dyMEAN, FAIR) on multiple benchmarks (CrossDocked, Binding MOAD, PPDBench, PDBBind RNA) in terms of Vina score, scRMSD, and AAR.  The model effectively generates high-affinity and valid pockets across various ligand modalities (small molecules, peptides, RNA). Ablation studies confirm the importance of both affinity and interaction geometry guidance.\n\n\n**Paper 3: A three-state kinetic mechanism for scaffold mediated signal transduction**\n\n1. **Title:** A three-state kinetic mechanism for scaffold mediated signal transduction\n\n2. **Abstract:** Signaling events in eukaryotic cells are often guided by a scaffolding protein. To study these effects, we consider a minimal, three-state kinetic model of scaffold-mediated kinase activation. We introduce and apply a path summation technique to obtain approximate solutions. We then consider exact numerical solutions. We comment on when this approximation is appropriate and then use this analysis to illustrate the competition of processes occurring at many time scales involved in signal transduction in the presence of a scaffold protein.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop and analyze a simplified kinetic model to understand how scaffold proteins influence the dynamics of kinase activation in cell signaling. The hypothesis is that the concentration of scaffold proteins affects the waiting time distribution of kinase activation, leading to different signaling dynamics (e.g., sharp vs. broad activation time distributions).\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A three-state kinetic model, analyzed using a path summation technique and exact numerical solutions, demonstrates how scaffold protein concentration modifies the waiting time distribution of kinase activation.  At low scaffold concentrations, activation is dominated by a single time scale, while at high concentrations, a more complex multi-exponential behavior emerges.  The model provides a mechanistic explanation for how scaffold proteins regulate signaling dynamics by controlling the competition between various processes occurring at different time scales.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Inverse Protein Folding Problem via Quadratic Programming**\n\n1. **Title:** Inverse Protein Folding Problem via Quadratic Programming\n\n2. **Abstract:** This paper presents a method of reconstructing the primary structure of a protein that folds into a given geometrical shape.  Unknown amino acids are determined according to the principle of energy minimization. This study represents the inverse folding problem as a quadratic optimization problem and uses different relaxation techniques to reduce it to the problem of convex optimizations. A computational experiment compares the quality of these approaches on real protein structures.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to formulate the inverse protein folding problem as a quadratic optimization problem and solve it using relaxation techniques. The hypothesis is that by minimizing the protein energy function, given a fixed backbone structure, an accurate prediction of the amino acid sequence can be achieved.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:**  Several optimization methods (Lagrangian relaxation, continuous relaxation, SDP relaxation, SQP, Simulated Annealing) were applied to solve the quadratic programming formulation of the inverse protein folding problem. SQP and Simulated Annealing showed the best optimization power, finding sequences with lower energy than the native state. However, the quality of primary structure prediction (as measured by BLOSUM62) was poor, suggesting limitations in the energy functions used.  The SDP and Lagrangian relaxation methods were computationally expensive for larger protein sequences.\n\n\n**Paper 5: What geometrically constrained folding models can tell us about real-world protein contact maps**\n\n1. **Title:** What geometrically constrained folding models can tell us about real-world protein contact maps\n\n2. **Abstract:** The mechanisms by which a protein\u2019s 3D structure can be determined based on its amino acid sequence have long been one of the key mysteries of biophysics. This paper investigates the emergent behavior of contact maps for different geometrically constrained models and real-world protein systems. An analytical approximation for the distribution of model amino acid distances is derived. This approximation is then validated for simulations using a 2D and 3D random interaction model, as well as from contact maps of real-world protein data.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to determine if simple geometric constraints alone can explain the observed distribution of amino acid distances in protein contact maps. The hypothesis is that the distribution of amino acid distances in real proteins is primarily determined by geometric constraints inherent in the folding process, and that the specific amino acid sequence plays a secondary role.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** An analytical approximation for the amino acid distance distribution is derived from a 2D geometrically constrained folding model. This approximation fits well to simulation data from 2D and 3D geometric models and also to real-world protein data from the RCSB PDB and AlphaFold2 databases, for various protein lengths (L \u2248 100, 200, 300).  The results suggest that geometric constraints are a major factor in shaping the amino acid distance distribution in proteins, although deviations, potentially linked to secondary structure, are observed for shorter distances.\n",
