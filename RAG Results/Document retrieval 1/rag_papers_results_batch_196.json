        "response": "Here's a summary of the main ideas and key results of each paper, based on the provided excerpts and metadata:\n\n\n**Paper 1: The role of evolutionary selection in the dynamics of protein structure evolution**\n\n1. **Title:** The role of evolutionary selection in the dynamics of protein structure evolution\n\n2. **Abstract:** Homology modeling is successful because proteins with only 30% identical sequences often share the same structure.  The paper investigates the non-linear sequence-structure relationship, hypothesizing that it emerges from selection for protein folding stability.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to investigate the non-linear relationship between protein sequence and structure divergence. The hypothesis is that this relationship arises due to selection for protein folding stability.  Fitness constraints prevent the emergence of unstable intermediates, preserving structure despite sequence divergence. Structure evolution is punctuated by rare events overcoming fitness barriers.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Bioinformatics analysis of protein domains shows a cusp-like relationship between sequence divergence and structure evolution, sharper for more stable proteins (higher contact density).  An analytical model, based on an activated process for structure evolution, fits the data well. Simulations confirm that selection pressure for stability modulates structure evolution rates; strong selection hinders it, while weak selection allows rapid exploration of structure space.  The model unifies observations about protein family sizes, prevalence of compact structures in ancient proteins, and faster structure evolution in less-packed proteins.\n\n\n**Paper 2: FoldMark: Protecting Protein Generative Models with Watermarking**\n\n1. **Title:** FoldMark: Protecting Protein Generative Models with Watermarking\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The paper addresses copyright and biosecurity concerns surrounding generative AI models for protein structure prediction/design.  It proposes FoldMark, a watermarking method to embed hidden information into generated protein structures for copyright authentication and tracking.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a robust watermarking technique for protein generative models. The hypothesis is that it is possible to embed watermarks into protein structures and models without significantly affecting their quality or functionality, enabling copyright protection and tracking of generated structures.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** FoldMark, a two-stage method, is presented. The first stage pre-trains a watermark encoder/decoder. The second stage fine-tunes protein generative models using WaterLoRA modules. Experiments on various models show near 100% watermark recovery accuracy with minimal impact on structure quality (scRMSD and RMSD). FoldMark is shown to be robust against post-processing and adaptive attacks.  Two application scenarios (detection and identification) are demonstrated, although identification accuracy decreases with a larger number of users.\n\n\n**Paper 3: Modelling the Establishment of PAR Protein Polarity in the One-Cell C. elegans Embryo**\n\n1. **Title:** Modelling the establishment of PAR protein polarity in the one-cell *C. elegans* embryo\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper models the dynamic process of PAR protein polarization in the *C. elegans* embryo, focusing on the interplay between reaction-diffusion dynamics of PAR proteins and actomyosin contraction.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to create a mathematical model to understand the mechanism of PAR protein polarization in *C. elegans* embryos. The hypothesis is that known interactions between PAR proteins, coupled with a simplified model of actomyosin contraction, are sufficient to explain the observed cortical PAR dynamics.  However, the model also explores additional mechanisms to explain cytoplasmic PAR protein polarity.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** A reaction-diffusion model incorporating known PAR protein interactions and actomyosin contraction reproduces many features of wild-type and mutant PAR dynamics.  However, the basic model fails to accurately predict cytoplasmic PAR protein polarity.  The authors propose that cytoplasmic cytoskeletal asymmetry, in addition to cortical actomyosin asymmetry, is crucial for generating proper cytoplasmic polarity.  The modified model, including this additional mechanism, better reproduces the observed dynamics.\n\n\n**Paper 4: Continuous monitoring of membrane protein micro-domain association during cell signaling**\n\n1. **Title:** Continuous monitoring of membrane protein micro-domain association during cell signaling\n\n2. **Abstract:** The paper describes a new method to quantify protein-lipid domain and protein-cytoskeleton interactions in intact cells, enabling continuous monitoring of these interactions during signaling.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a non-destructive method for real-time monitoring of membrane protein interactions with microdomains (lipid rafts and cytoskeletal fences). The hypothesis is that this method can provide insights into how changes in membrane ultrastructure influence cell signaling.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The authors present binned-imaging FCS (bimFCS), a method using spatially resolved camera-based FCS to simultaneously measure protein diffusion across multiple area sizes.  BimFCS distinguishes between free diffusion, diffusion hindered by transient trapping in domains (lipid rafts), and diffusion hindered by cytoskeletal fences.  Experiments demonstrate the method's ability to track changes in protein-domain association induced by ion channel gating, antibody cross-linking, and cholesterol extraction in real time.  The method is shown to be useful for studying dynamic changes in membrane ultrastructure during cell signaling.\n\n",
