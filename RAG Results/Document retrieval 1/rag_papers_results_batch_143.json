Nanoplasmonic Tweezers Visualize Protein p53 Suppressing Unzipping of Single DNA-Hairpins**\n\n1. **Title:** Nanoplasmonic Tweezers Visualize Protein p53 Suppressing Unzipping of Single DNA-Hairpins\n\n2. **Abstract:** The authors demonstrate the use of double-nanohole (DNH) optical tweezers to study protein-DNA interactions at the single-molecule level without labels or tethers.  They show that p53 protein delays the unzipping of DNA hairpins, quantifying the energy barrier introduced by p53 as 2\u00d710\u207b\u00b2\u2070 J.  A p53 mutant (cys135ser) showed no such suppression, potentially explaining its inability to suppress tumor growth.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a novel, label-free, and free-solution single-molecule technique using DNH optical tweezers to study protein-DNA interactions, specifically focusing on the role of p53 in DNA unzipping.  The hypothesis is that p53 protein will suppress DNA hairpin unzipping, and this effect will be absent in a non-functional p53 mutant.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** DNH tweezers successfully trapped and unzipped 10 bp DNA hairpins. Wild-type p53 significantly slowed unzipping, with an estimated energy barrier of 2.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2070 J.  The cys135ser p53 mutant did not affect unzipping, supporting the hypothesis that its inability to suppress tumors is linked to its inability to stabilize DNA.  This technique offers a novel approach for studying protein-DNA interactions with high sensitivity and without the limitations of conventional methods.\n\n\n**2. Metamorphic Proteins in light of Anfinsen\u2019s Dogma**\n\n1. **Title:** Metamorphic Proteins in light of Anfinsen\u2019s Dogma\n\n2. **Abstract:** The author argues that metamorphic proteins do not challenge Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis.  They suggest that metamorphic proteins fulfill Anfinsen's dogma by exhibiting marginal stability comparable to other biomolecules.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to reconcile the existence of metamorphic proteins (proteins adopting different folds under native conditions) with Anfinsen's dogma (the protein's amino acid sequence determines its 3D structure). The hypothesis is that metamorphic proteins do not violate Anfinsen's dogma; their multiple folds represent an ensemble of near-native states, all consistent with marginal stability.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The author presents examples of metamorphic proteins (protein A, Mad2, Ltn) and demonstrates that in each case, a native state exists for a given experimental milieu.  The coexistence of different folds is explained within the context of Anfinsen's dogma as an ensemble of conformations around a free-energy minimum.  The marginal stability of these proteins is consistent with an upper bound of approximately 7.4 kcal/mol.  The author concludes that metamorphic proteins do not challenge Anfinsen's dogma.\n\n\n**3. GNN-PT\uff1aEnhanced Prediction of Compound-protein Interactions by Integrating Protein Transformer**\n\n1. **Title:** GNN-PT\uff1aEnhanced Prediction of Compound-protein Interactions by Integrating Protein Transformer\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The authors propose a novel model, GNN-PT, for predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs).  This model integrates a graph neural network (GNN) for compound representation and a new \"Protein Transformer\" (PT) module for protein representation, utilizing a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range interactions within protein sequences.  The results demonstrate significant performance improvement compared to existing CPI models.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to improve CPI prediction accuracy by incorporating the self-attention mechanism into the protein representation module. The hypothesis is that capturing long-range interactions within protein sequences using self-attention will lead to better feature extraction and improved prediction performance.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** The GNN-PT model, incorporating the Protein Transformer module, outperforms several existing methods (KNN, RF, logR, SVM, and a previous GNN-based model) across multiple datasets (human and C. elegans) and different positive/negative ratios. The improvement is attributed to the effective capture of long-range interactions within proteins by the self-attention mechanism in the Protein Transformer.\n\n\n**4. Wolumes - An algorithm to compute the volume of atoms and residues in proteins**\n\n1. **Title:** Wolumes - An algorithm to compute the volume of atoms and residues in proteins\n\n2. **Abstract:**  The paper introduces Wolumes, a fast and stand-alone C program for computing atom and residue volumes in proteins.  The algorithm discretizes space using a grid of points and uses van der Waals radii to assign volume to atoms.  Comparison with other methods shows comparable accuracy but significantly faster computation.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to develop a fast and accurate algorithm for computing atom and residue volumes in proteins. The hypothesis is that a simple grid-based discretization method can provide comparable accuracy to more complex methods, but with significantly improved computational speed.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** Wolumes accurately computes atom and residue volumes, comparable to other methods like VLDP and ATVOL, but is significantly faster (tens of times faster than ATVOL).  Analysis of a large set of protein structures reveals the distribution of atom and residue volumes, showing a correlation between residue volume and the number of atoms.  The program identifies atoms and residues with unusually large or small volumes.  The software is freely available.\n\n\n**5. Benchmarking AlphaFold3\u2019s protein-protein complex accuracy and machine learning prediction reliability for binding free energy changes upon mutation**\n\n1. **Title:** Benchmarking AlphaFold3\u2019s protein-protein complex accuracy and machine learning prediction reliability for binding free energy changes upon mutation\n\n2. **Abstract:** The authors evaluate the accuracy and reliability of AlphaFold3 (AF3) in predicting protein-protein complexes and their binding free energy (BFE) changes upon mutation. Using the SKEMPI 2.0 database, they find that while AF3 achieves a good Pearson correlation coefficient (0.86) for BFE change prediction, it leads to a higher RMSE (8.6% increase) than using original PDB structures.  The study highlights limitations of AF3 in predicting flexible regions and the lack of correlation between AF3's ipTM metric and structural alignment accuracy.\n\n3. **Main idea and hypothesis:** The main idea is to benchmark the performance of AlphaFold3 (AF3) in predicting protein-protein complexes and its reliability for predicting mutation-induced binding free energy changes. The hypothesis is that AF3 will provide accurate protein-protein complex structures that can be used to reliably predict BFE changes upon mutation.\n\n4. **Summary of Results:** AF3 achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient (Rp) of 0.86 for predicting mutation-induced BFE changes, slightly lower than the 0.88 achieved with original PDB structures.  AF3 resulted in an 8.6% increase in RMSE compared to PDB structures. The study reveals a lack of correlation between AF3's ipTM score and structural alignment RMSD, suggesting limitations in the ipTM metric. AF3 predictions are unreliable for intrinsically flexible regions, as evidenced by high RMSD in these regions.\n",
